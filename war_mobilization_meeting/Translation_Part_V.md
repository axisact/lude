If there is no doubt, then we will focus on the three main tasks about recruiting soldiers, mobilizing maritime support, and mobilizing the forces of the combat in novel-domains and capabilities.

没有的话，我们就围绕兵源征召、海上支援动员、新域新质力量动员，三类主要任务一起研究一下。

&nbsp;

First of all, let’s discuss the issue of recruiting soldiers, please make a speech. 

首先研究兵源征召问题，请大家发言。

&nbsp;

Commander, let me make a speech about the issue of urgency of recruitment from three aspects:

指挥员，针对当前兵源征召时间紧迫的问题，我们考虑从三个方面加强征召速度。

&nbsp;

First，In order to recruit soldiers as soon as possible first time quickly, directly with the help of big data technology to lock the right candidate, and then handed over to the grassroots organization staff to complete the recruitment.*(The big data of CCP has personal data of all people and can quickly screen suitable personnel for the type of soldiers)*

一，是确定对象快，借助大数据技术发挥基层组织工作，依托越市指挥控制中心，第一时间发布征召工作报告。

*注：为尽快第一时间快速招募兵源，直接借助大数据技术锁定合适人选，再交由基层组织人员完成最快招兵。（中共大数据拥有所有人的个人数据，可以迅速筛选适合兵种的人员）。*

&nbsp;

Second, Immediate physical examination and investigation of political affiliation. Simultaneously organize physical examinations and historical investigations of political affiliation, and determine the recruiting target at the first time.

二，是体检政考快，同步组织体检政考的历史调查，第一时间把征召对象定下来。

&nbsp;

Third, assemble and handover quickly. Coordinate with the military transportation department, quickly organize and arrange transportation plans, assemble and deliver personnel before the time nodes.

三，是集结交接快，协调对接军交部门快速组织安排启运计划，第一时间把人员集结起来，按时间节点送到位。

&nbsp;

It is suggested that Health and Public Security Departments should assist in opening up special channels for the off-site physical examinations and investigation of political affiliation across the province to provide the on-the-spot services for recruitment.

为此，建议如卫健委等多部门协助开通全省异地体检、异地政考特殊通道，为应征人员提供隨到隨檢服務。

&nbsp;

Deputy Secretary, please make sure to accomplish the off-site physical examinations and investigations of political affiliation across the province.

副秘书长，异地体检、异地政考，请你们协调落实好！

&nbsp;

Ok! I’d like to add up!

好的！我再补充一点！

&nbsp;

We have feedback that since we’re going to start a war now, some people are eager to participate, while others are afraid, timid, and escaping from the war!

据反映，现在真要打仗了，既有人踊跃报名参战，也有人畏战、怯战、避战！

&nbsp;

I suggest we should strengthen the effort of propaganda. All mainstream media should propagate our determination of strategic victory to conquer Taiwan, which relates to the reunification of China and the great rejuvenation of the nation! And we should also stimulate the people’s determination to fight against our enemies together in Guangdong province. 

我建议，一方面宣传范围要广，各主流媒体要大张旗鼓，宣传我对台战略决胜，关乎祖国完成统一，关乎民族伟大复兴！激发全省人民同仇敌忾，全民支前一致对敌的决心意志！

&nbsp;

On the other hand, we should increase the efforts of soldier assistance! Regarding the new recruits, we should solve their problems, regularly comfort them and eliminate their concerns after the recruitment. For their outstanding performances, especially the soldiers who get awards, we should notify their families timely, reward them publicly and treat them well.

另一方面帮扶力度要大！针对应征人员，建立解困台账，定期走访慰问上门服务，消除其后顾之忧，掌握应征参战情况。对表现突出，尤其是立功受奖的，及时上门报喜，公开表彰奖励，并搞好抚恤优待。

&nbsp;

I’d like to add that, besides positive incentives, we must strengthen punishment in accordance with the law! For those who refuse to be recruited, the government should persuade them timely or impose administrative sanctions according to law. Those who are members of CCP, should be punished according to the Party's discipline. If the circumstances are serious, punish them severely and expose them publicly according to the Criminal Law and Military Service Law.

我补充一点，除正面激励以外，还要依法加大惩处力度！对拒不应征者，政府部门抢先上门做工作指导，依法予以行政处分，属中共党员的，按党纪处分，情节严重的，依据刑法、兵役法进行严处！并予以曝光。

&nbsp;

End of report!
报告完毕！
