Based on existing methods of recruitment, Departments at all levels in Guangdong should set up a Wartime Recruitment Agency. Government departments such as health, public security, education, and veteran service must cooperate fully. Try the best to serve for the recruitment and make greater effort to propaganda. No matter how urgent and difficult the task is, we must complete it in time with high standards.

全省各级，以现有征兵方式为基础。成立战时兵源征招机构。衛健，公安，教育，退役军人等政府部门要全力配合。采取调度防御措施，最大限度为兵源征招工作亮绿灯，要加大宣传。抓足本土记录，时间再紧，任务再重，也要把控时间节点，高标准完成！

&nbsp;

Next, let’s discuss the issue of mobilizing maritime support. Please make a speech!

下面我们接着研究海上支援动员令，请大家发言。

&nbsp;

I’d like to make a speech about ship weaponization.
我就船舶加改装问题作发言。

&nbsp;

The task assigned by the Southern Theater Command is to complete 365 ships weaponization （include ro-ro ships）within 45 days. In addition, there are 64 ships occupied by the national departments within our jurisdiction, and 8 ships are literally assigned to our province.

战区下达的任务是，45天内完成365艘滚装船等，各类船舶的加改装，此外辖域内国家层面占用资源64艘船，还有8艘，明确由我省负责。

&nbsp;

There are 90 capable ship repair and construction enterprises in the whole province, which can weaponize 113 ships at one time. And 280 ships can be weaponized within this month in total.

全省具备能力的船舶修造企业90家，能够一次性总共组织113艘船加改装，这月内可完成280艘。

&nbsp;

However, considering the distribution of those enterprises, high-quality ship repair and construction sources are mostly integrated in Guangzhou, Yangjiang and  Dongguan. The ability to weaponize ships in eastern Guangdong is weak.

但从布局情况看，优质船舶新造资源集中在广州，阳江，东莞等地。粤东地区船舶新造力量薄弱！

&nbsp;

So we suggest three methods to solve.

我们拟采取三种办法实施。

&nbsp;

First, integrate advantages. By making full use of large repair and construction shipyard in the whole province, integrate those ships of more than 1,000 tons, and then classify and weaponize those ships.

一是，聚优集中，利用全省大型修造船厂，组织千吨级以上输送船舶，分类集中实施。

&nbsp;

Second, multi-point distribution. 23 wharfs are selected in coastal cities to quickly weaponize the fishing ship.

二是，多点分布，沿海各市选取23处码头，多点快速组织机渔船加改装。

&nbsp;

Third, transfer sources. Transfer sources from Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Zhanjiang to strengthen the ability of weaponization in eastern GuangDong. 

三是，跨区资源，从广州，江门，湛江抽组船舶修造力量，加强至粤东地区。

&nbsp;

I suggest, coordinating with the Agricultural and Rural Economic Organization, the relevant task is headed by us and then we impose it on all cities.

相关工作建议由我们牵头，汇同省农业农村经济厅组织指导各市，推进落实。

&nbsp;

You undertake and implement this task. You should also foresee all kinds of complicated situations, especially to strengthen the defense of shipyards and ensure the purchase and supply of raw materials and accessories. Think carefully in all aspects and make sure to implement this task in time.

这个事情就由你们牵头加落实。你们还要充分预想各种复杂情况，特别要加强修造船厂的防护，以及源材料和配件的采购、供给。把方方面面想细，想全，确保按时完成任务。

&nbsp;

It was mentioned that the cadres and equipment deployment should be strengthened in the mobilization task proposal. What do you think about it?

刚才，动员任务建议里面，提到要加强随船人员装备编配，这个问题大家有什么考虑？

&nbsp;

Commander! Regarding the fleet formation and the deployment of personnel and equipment, we prepare to do as follow.

指挥员！关于船队编组和人员装备的分配，我们准备这样安排。

&nbsp;

First, strengthen the deployment of cadres on ships. According to the different aim and usage of support tasks, cadres are divided into 3 brigades, 45 squadrons, and 135 divisions. There are 231 cadres on board, including 3 regimental cadres, 45 battalion cadres and 183 other army cadres.

一，配强随船干部，按照保障项目和具体使用的不同，编成3个大队，45个中队，135支分队。准备随船干部231人，其中团职3名，营职45名，其他军地干部183名。

&nbsp;

Second, optimize the deployment of militia on ships. Take a mix mode based on crew, veterans and equipment. The delivery ship mainly focuses on defense, medical staff and correspondent are also included in. 10,000-ton ships are equipped with a Platoon, 1,000-ton and 100-ton ships are equipped with a Squad. Each group of militia is equipped with defense forces and the equipment operators.

二，优化船上民兵，采取主要船员，加退伍军人，加装备混编模式。输送船舶主要編配防卫力量，加医疗人员，加通讯员。万吨船配团,千吨船配班，百吨级船员船只配班，各组民兵分隊主要编配防备力量，加主要装备操作手。

&nbsp;

Third, install all kinds of high-tech equipment to meet the demands of the latest tasks of the maritime militia. More than 2,000 sets of high-tech unmanned equipment are installed for the militia fighting, such as radar and sonar.

三，加载高新装备，围绕海上民兵最新任务需要。为民兵打仗加装各种无人装备，雷达、声呐等高新装备设备2000多件套。

Comrade Jun Zou! The National Defense Mobilization Center demanded 231 cadres on board. Can we meet these demands?

邹军同志！国防动员中心提出231名随船干部需求，能不能满足？

&nbsp;

According to the tasks and preparation of each department, we unified deployment of core cadres. Now, there are still a lack of 68 military cadres and 91 civil cadres. It is suggested to solve it in three ways as follow:

我们根据各单位的任务和编制情况，对干部骨干进行了统一调配。目前还缺现役干部68名，地方干部91名，建议从三个途径解决：

&nbsp;

First, deploy cadres from inland military sub-commands. Especially those 57 regimental cadres, who ever participated in major maritime rights protection actions, should be added in according to the law.

一，从内地军分区调剂，特别是参加过海上重大维权行动，海军交流进来的团职干部，共有57名，可以依律补充。

&nbsp;

Second, select civil cadres. Cadres from the fishery, fishery administration system and grassroots-level department, who have rich experience in maritime rights protection, should be selected as a commander.

二，从地方干部中选配，主要从渔业，渔政系统和基层专务干部选拔熟悉情况，海上维权经验丰富的同志担任指挥员。

&nbsp;

Third, apply to the superior for dispatch. Apply to the National Defense Mobilization Department for urgently dispatching some cadres with rich experience in maritime rights protection.

三，向上级申请调配，向军委国防动员部申请，紧急调入部分海上行动经验丰富的海上维权干部。
