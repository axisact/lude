# 理解人民战争

&emsp;&emsp;“人民”在中共的定义里并不是简单指代“人”，“国民”，“公民”或者“平民”的概念。 “国民”或“公民”是来自西方民主思潮下的对一个国家内的人的定义，这个带有民主思想，允许个体在法律范围内拥有自由，拥有公民责任的概念是中共不接受的。

&emsp;&emsp;The definition of "people" in the Chinese Communist Party does not simply refer to "people," "nationals," "citizens," or " civilians”. The term  "national" or "citizen" defines a person living within a country, and stems from Western democratic ideology.This term with democratic ideologies, which allows individuals to have freedom and responsibilities of citizenship under law, has not been recognized by the Chinese Communist Party.

&emsp;&emsp;在中共的概念里，“人民”是一个政治词汇。 “人民”被赋予了阶级的政治含义，“人民”是统治阶级的对立面，或者说“人民”是一切反对共产主义的对立面。列宁曾经说过：“人民是能够把革命进行到底的一定成分”。在中共的发展中，被包括在“人民”这个群体中的各类人群不断增加，毛泽东曾经提出“人民”是“除了工人，农民和城市小资产意外以外，还要加上一切其他阶级中愿意参加民族革命的分子”。但无论“人民”包括了谁，“人民”的本质一直都是中共组织体系里一的一个组成部分。也就是说“人民”这个角色是要为党做贡献的。

&emsp;&emsp;In the Chinese Communist Party's concept, "people '' is nothing more than a political word."People '' has been given a political meaning of hierarchy. The "people '' are the antithesis of the dominant hierarchy, in other words, "people" who are opposed to communism. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin once said, "The people are the necessary elements that can carry the revolution to the end." In the process of the expansion of the CCP, the groups of people involved among the "people '' have been constantly increasing. Mao Zedong was saying that the "people '' were "not only workers, peasants and urban petite bourgeoisie, but also all other individuals of the hierarchy who are willing to work for the National Revolution”. But whoever the "people '' involved, the essence of the "people" will always be an essential element of the Communist Party's organizational system, Which means that the role of the "people" should be a contribution to the party.

&emsp;&emsp;既然”人民“是一个政治角色，那么”人民“就有自己的政治义务，那就是拥护共产党。通过听党话跟党走这样的方式拥护。中共国的五星红旗就是”人民“拥护党的体现。中共治下只允许有“人民”，不允许有人。当一个人的表现脱离了“人民”的范畴，那么他不再是“人民”，而是站在“人民”对立面的敌人，是一个需要被斗争被批判的敌人。

&emsp;&emsp;As the " people " is a political role, the " people " has its own political obligation, that is, to support the Communist Party, by obeying the Party and doing what the Party demands and following it. The five-star red flag of the Communist Party of China is the embodiment of the "people's" loyalty to the Party. Under the Chinese Communist Party, only the "people" are allowed to exist, not human beings. When someone's behavior is out of the scope of "the people", that person is no longer "the people", but an enemy standing against "the people", an enemy to be denounced and criticized.

&emsp;&emsp;中共向来非常看重“人民，毛泽东早早提出“为人民服务”，人们广义以为这是对生活在这个国家里人们好，这是对中共政治思想大错特错的理解。

&emsp;&emsp;The Chinese Communist Party has always put a lot of attention on "the people", Mao Zedong put forward the idea of "serving the people" at an early stage, which was widely believed that it was for the well-being of the people living in the country, this is an extremely misunderstanding of the political ideology of the Chinese Communist Party.

&emsp;&emsp;共产党通过服务“人民”这个政治团体服务，来增加党的利益，提升党的自身实力。例如中共支持民营企业，中共不是为了这些民营企业的老板或者员工个人利益，而是中共是通过服务于”人民“这个属于自己组织内一个团体来壮大自己。说白了“为人民服务”就是为中共自己牟利，与老百姓没有任何关系。

&emsp;&emsp;The Communist Party takes advantage of serving the "people", as a political group, to boost the Party's interests and enhance its own strength. For instance, the CCP's support for private enterprises is not for the personal benefit of the owners or employees in these private enterprises, instead, the CCP uses it to strengthen itself by serving the "people" as a group belonging to its own organization. To be clear, "serving the people" is for the CCP's own benefits, and has nothing at all to do with the ordinary people.

&emsp;&emsp;那中共到底是如何理解”人民“这个政治群体对他们的重要性呢？ ”战争伟力之最深厚根源“毛泽东在《民兵是胜利之本》中提到这个概念。 ”广泛的热烈的政治动员，这样，要几百万人当兵都是容易的....动员了人民，财政也不成问题，岂有如此广土众民的国家而患财穷之理“？对于“人民”对重要性，习近平也说过“人民”是党力量党源泉，是关乎党生死的重要。

&emsp;&emsp;How exactly does the CCP understand the importance of the "people" as a political group to them? "The deepest root of war's power," Mao Zedong states in “The Militia is the Basis of Victory". "Extensive and enthusiastic political mobilization, then, it is quite easy to recruit millions of people into the military ....If the people are mobilized, there will be no issue with the finances. How can a country with such a vast land and many people suffer from financial poverty? As for the importance of "the people", Xi Jinping has also said that "the people" are the foundation of the party's authority. It is about the existence or extinction of the party.

&emsp;&emsp;从什么是“人民”，“人民”在中共组织中的重要性，我们不难看出，中共的生死很大程度上是依托在“人民”上的。他们的是寄托在“人民”身上的寄生党。

&emsp;&emsp;By looking at what the "people" are and the importance of the "people" in the CCP organization, not surprisingly, it is quite easy to tell that the survival and the fate of the CCP is highly dependent on the "people". The CCP is a parasitical party that must stick to the "people to survival".

&emsp;&emsp;中共是一个极其严密的庞大组织。只要被中共划入其政治概念范围内的任何个体，都是其组织的一部分，无论这个个体人在哪里，是什么样的人，自己是否有意愿成为组织的一部分都不重要，他们必须是。否则就是站在的党和“人民”的对立面。是一个要被消灭要被斗争的个体。

&emsp;&emsp;The CCP is an extremely rigorous and huge organization. It does not matter where the individual is, what kind of person they are, or whether they want to be part of the organization,  they must be a part of the Party, as long as any individual falls within the scope of its political concept by the CCP.

&emsp;&emsp;要求被划入“人民”范畴内的个体必须拥护党是一件非常困难的事情，这主要因为每个个体骨子里都有独立的意志以及对自由的天然向往。成为“人民”其实是在消灭每个人内在的独立。要是保证“人民”民心不散，就必须长期大量洗脑，同时不断用恐惧威胁每个人，让每个人在恐惧的笼罩和洗脑后失去自我的情况下，自觉或被迫的站在“人民”的队伍里。这样表面看似“人民”队伍甚是庞大，但实际上在维持“人民”上的大量消耗中共国的人力物力和财力。即便如此大部分的人，尤其是今天，“人民”是对拥护党消极怠慢的。所以动员就格外的重要，中共必须让“人民”为了中共的政治利益赴汤蹈火是决定中共胜利与否的根本。

&emsp;&emsp;It is very challenging to demand that individuals classified as "people" must support the Party, primarily because each individual has an independent will and a natural desire for freedom in his or her blood. Becoming the " people " is actually the elimination of each person's innate independence. To ensure that the will of people not be scattered, it is absolutely required to continuously brainwash for a long period of time, while constantly intimidating everyone with fear, so that everyone, under the shadow of fear and brainwashing, and after losing themselves, they will voluntarily or by force stand in the group of the "people" eventually. On the surface, it seems that the "people" team is quite powerful and numerous, but on the contrary, it is a huge drain on the human, material and financial resources of the Chinese Communist Party to manage and sustain the "people". However, the majority, especially nowadays, are negative and unwilling to support the Party. Therefore, mobilization is doubly important, and the CCP must do whatever it takes to ensure that the "people" will go through fire and water for the CCP’s political interests, because that is the essential step to determine whether the CCP will succeed or not.


&emsp;&emsp;另外，“人民”虽然是一个政治概念，但是“人民”一词在中共国从来不明确想他们的“人民”表明其定义。绝大部分中共的“人民”都以为这个词就是代表人，代表每个人的根本利益。中共自己必然知道，如果他们把“人民”的真实含义表明，就意味着让人们知道他们的真实面目。所以“人民”长期生活在被他们渲染的岁月静好的日子里，几乎不知道自己的政治义务。当中共需要“人民”为自己挺身而出的时候，“人民”是不知道自己的角色的。这个时候就必须动员起来“人民”参与到党的战争或斗争中去。这样的动员是有效的，在长期的洗脑下，在每个人的概念中党国概念不分，自我利益和党的利益不分。加上中共的威逼利诱和各种恐吓胁迫配合着洗脑动员，“人民”要么怀着热忱投入到战斗中，要么在逼迫下投入到战斗中，要么在反抗中被消失。

&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, although "people" is a political concept, the term "people" is never clearly defined to refer to their "people" in the Communist Party. The majority of the Chinese Communist Party's "people" think that the word refers to people/human, representing the fundamental interests of each individual.The Chinese Communist Party surely understands that if they make clear the true meaning of "people", people will know what they really are. Hence they have been living peacefully and tranquilly for a long time, barely conscious of their political obligations. When the CCP demands the "people" to stand up for the Party, the "people" have no idea how to stand up. It is time to mobilize the "people" to engage in the Party's political wars or conflicts. After a long period of brainwashing, the concept of Party and Country was blurred in everyone's perception, as well as there was no distinction between self-interest and Party interest for them. Furthermore, the Chinese Communist Party's bullying and coercion, together with brainwashing and mobilization, either drove the "people" into the battle with enthusiasm, or forced them into it under compulsion, or they disappeared due to resistance.

&emsp;&emsp;理解了什么是“人民”，以及中共与“人民的”关系，我们就不难理解什么事人民战争。这个就是发动可利用的所有“人民”参与到中共的战争中。把“人民”化妆成国际社会普遍以为的平民，以此迷惑西方，牵制西方，利用西方法律对平民的保护来作为盾牌，与西方军队打仗，借此获胜。

&emsp;&emsp;Once we understand what "the people" are and the relationship between the CCP and "the people," it is not difficult to recognize the people's war. This is a tactic to mobilize all people who can be used to participate in the CCP's war. By disguising the "people" as civilians generally considered by the international community, in order to confuse the Western world, contain the Western world, use the Western laws of protection civilians as a shield to win the war against Western armies.

&emsp;&emsp;西方会诧异，为什么中国人把自己当财产拿出来为中共直接使用。在他们的公民思维里，个人财产不可侵犯的起码的社会准则中，他们根本无法想像，在中共这个地方，人甚至连自己都不是自己的，他们连自己是一个基本人的资格都被剥夺了，取而代之的是沦为政治的工具，共党利益的炮灰。

&emsp;&emsp;Western countries would be astonished and confused why people in China give themselves out like property for the direct use of the CCP. In their citizenship mindset, personal property is inviolable as a minimum social norm, they will never understand in the Chinese Communist Party that no one belongs to themselves. They are deprived of the basic right to be a human being, but instead they are treated like political tools, and ready to sacrifice their life for the benefit of the CCP.

&emsp;&emsp;虽然“人民”这个组织庞大看似有力，但实际上“人民”本身就是中共最大的弱点。因为他们是寄生在“人民”身上的，“人民”也并非完全可控。如前文所说，向往自由是每个个体的天性。即便是强大的控制也不能做到所有的控制。大概在两年前，中国人发出“躺平”的观点时，中央电视台出面反对。为什么他们这么害怕躺平，这意味着他们赖以寄生的“人民”拒绝成为“人民”。当丫丫先生发表的独立宣言，一个人一张纸让中共无比恐惧，因为每个人的独立是瓦解中共最强大的利刃。没有了“人民”，中共就没有了赖以生存的基石。虽然中共严重渗透西方社会，但是西方的文明也在给那些被禁锢许久的灵魂们带来了久违的甘露。觉醒与自由在一点点进入这个被红色恐怖笼罩许久的大地。很多人面对中共强大的压迫总说我能怎么办，我也没有办法呀。其实每个人从心里拒绝做人民，就是强大的反抗。

&emsp;&emsp;Despite the seemingly powerful and huge organization of the "people," and the "people" themselves are actually the CCP's most fatal weakness. Because they are a parasite living with the " people ", but the " people'' are not entirely controllable. As I said before, it is the innate nature of every individual to yearn for freedom. No one can control everything, even with strong power and weapons. About two years ago, when the Chinese raised the idea of "lying on our back"（It refers to no longer serving the Party and no longer being enslaved）, CCTV was against it at first time. Why are they so afraid of lying on our backs? It implies that the "people" on whom they are living refuse to be "the people" any more. When Mr. Ma (Twitter Name: Ya Ya ) declared his declaration of independence, one person and one piece of paper makes the Chinese Communist Party extremely terrified, because the independence of each person is the most powerful weapon to destroy the Chinese Communist Party. Without the "people," the CCP is without the cornerstone to survive on. Although the CCP is deeply infiltrating Western society, the civilization of the Western world is bringing long-lost manna to the souls of those who have been caged for a long time. Awareness and freedom are gradually penetrating into this land, which has been blanketed by the Red Terror over a long period of time. Many people, when faced with the powerful Chinese Communist Party's intimidation, always say, "What can I do?” This answer is doing nothing, each person's resistance to being a “people” from the heart is a powerful rebellion.

&emsp;&emsp;我们需要让西方社会知道什么是“人民”，什么是人民战争，我们也要让西方知道，中国人骨子里也有对自由的向往。中国人是被利用的强制划入“人民”的范畴。我们要让对中共对抗的西方社会知道，我们需要寻找方法，唤醒“人民”，让“人民”回归人本。

&emsp;&emsp;We have to let the West know what "the people" are and what the people's war is, but also to let the Western world know that the Chinese also have a desire for freedom in their blood. The Chinese are being used and forced into the category of "the people". It is important for us to let Western society know that the CCP is about to have a war against the Western civilization. At the same time, we need to figure out a way to wake up the "people" and help the "people" back to their human nature.
