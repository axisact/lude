&nbsp;

00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096

非常可怕的是你想象不到，

我就告訴你澳大利亞現在是啥情況

It's very horrible that you can't imagine that

I'll tell you what's going on in Australia right now


&nbsp;

00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,680

澳大利亚现在是

Australia is going to have  

&nbsp;

00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,216

五月份大選

election in May

&nbsp;

00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,520

你知道現在那個莫里森

一直是很支持美國的麽

You know that the (PM) Morrison 

has always been very supportive of the United States, right?

&nbsp;

00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,360

是liberal，是自由的

He is from Liberal Party of Australia, the Liberal

&nbsp;

00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736

工黨，我告訴你工黨他絕對不是

工黨他絕對不是，而且我告訴你

（求助：不知道如何翻译）

&nbsp;

00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,344

澳大利亞現在的西澳跟南澳，昆士蘭

Australia nowadays, including Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland

&nbsp;

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624

這幾個最大的礦業和資源省

These are some of the largest mining and resource states

&nbsp;

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392

我跟您說，實際上來説，非常非常的（聽不清）。

幾乎拿下整個澳大利亞的

（求助：不知道如何翻译）


&nbsp;

00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840

那像悉尼是新南威爾士州

然後礦業最大的省

You know Sydney is in New South Wales 

which is the largest mining state

&nbsp;

00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400

那你去查查 西澳

Then look up Western Australia


&nbsp;

00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448

都是最有錢的，最有實力的都在那邊

All the richest and most powerful people are there


&nbsp;

00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496

那是肯定是，肯定是人家中國的實力了

That's for sure, it's definitely owned by China

&nbsp;

00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,592

你昆士蘭已經也全是了

Queensland(is owned by China),too

&nbsp;

00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872

你現在南澳，南澳

South Australia and South Australia

&nbsp;

00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968

人家現在也都是，那個的了

are all owned by China

&nbsp;

00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,344

你知道有個是  Penny Wong 的麽

是那個 ，一個工黨的一個領袖

在那個影子政府裏面的一個人

Do you know Penny Wong?

Who is a leader of the Labor Party.

A person in the shadow government.

&nbsp;

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,416

就是也是有华人血统的这些东西都是

She is Chinese Australian

&nbsp;

00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208

三代以前就設置好的東西

您懂嗎

Something that was planned three generations ago.

Do you understand?


&nbsp;

00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304

就是 都已經混了東南亞的血統了

您根本就很難去弄這個事

而且這些已經都混了東南亞血統的人

他们本身就會拉攏很多東南亞的勢力

這就是爲什麽在聯合國大會上

連你198個成員國，

你98個其實你還沒到一半呢

就完全支持的

你懂我意思麽

而且這中間後面還有變數

你有沒有想過 這次的98個

這次的棄權的人比上次要多了呀


It's all mixed up with Southeast Asian race.

It's very difficult to figure this out.

And these who have Southeast Asian mix,

they will get support from certain group in Southeast Asia

That's why in the UN General Assembly

Even you have 198 members,

98 in fact is not even half of 198

that fully support 

Do you know what I mean?

And there might be changes later

Have you ever predicted about the 98 members this time?

This time more countries abstained than last time 


&nbsp;

00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368

所以説，我的建議啊，美國千萬別衝動

So, my advice, the United States do not be impulsive


&nbsp;

00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,720

如果我是美國的，智庫裏面的人

我就會一定要告訴美國

美國人這個時候千萬別衝動

If I work for a U.S. think tank

I would tell America

American should not be impulsive at this time

&nbsp;

00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,096

這個時候不管是美國衝動

還是中國衝動

At this time, no matter America 

or China, whoever take reckless actions

&nbsp;

00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144

你誰衝動

你下一步你就很難在國際上

You will have a hard time in the next step internationally

&nbsp;

00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984

有 更有利的輿論也好

或者是各方面的

這個正面的東西也好

你懂嗎

either have a more favorable public opinion or

or any other aspects. 

Anything positive.

Do you understand?

&nbsp;

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640

因爲 在這個世界上

咱們都是普通人

但很多政客人家都是

Because in this world

We are all ordinary people

But many politicians and their families are

&nbsp;

00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176

盯著這個事的

on this.


&nbsp;

00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456

他會想 就説

 你看 這美國怎麽

They're going to think and say:

Look, why America 

&nbsp;

00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528

還突然間去牽制那個

你看這習也沒吱聲啊

其實他習就是不吱聲啊

那他不吱聲那是明哲保身

那要是我要是習

你要是習

contains other country in a sudden?

You see Xi didn't do anything.

If fact Xi will choose to do nothing,

and it keep him safe.

If I were Xi,

If you were Xi,

&nbsp;

你也不吱聲啊 對不對

所以說 路德先生啊

我的意思就是說

我是希望就是說

而且就是你

對於美國一直提出的那個事

我要推翻中共這個

説實話路德先生

這個吧

我 我 我如實跟您說吧

我認爲這事不現實

You'll also keep your mouth shut, right?

So, Mr Lude,

My point is

It is

something you always

talk about that America is going to 

take down the CCP.

To be honest with you, Mr Lude

Hmmm,

I just wanna be honest with you,

I think it is not realistic.
