Good job! Such mobilization at sea is very important! Apart from what you just mentioned, the issue of mobilization at sea must be resolved!

好！海上这样动员非常重要！除了你们刚才讲到的，海上的动员问题一定要解决好！

&nbsp;

The National Defense Mobilization Center and the political work department should reasonably allocate manpowers and core team, and the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee should cooperate with the relevant work.

国防动员中心和政治工作部门要合理调配兵力和骨干，省委组织部，省人事厅，要做好配合相关工作。

&nbsp;

Next, we will continue to study the combat in novel-domains and capabilities. Let me ask a question. I mentioned that the ship needs to add more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment. How is everything prepared?

下面，我们接着研究新域新质动员，先问一个问题，刚才提到船舶需要加大两千多件高新装备，你们准备的怎么样？

&nbsp;

With more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment, 480 drones and 70 unmanned boats are currently in place. Need to catch up to switch control.

这两千多件高新装备，目前确保到位的无人机480架，无人艇70艘。需要抓紧时机转控。

&nbsp;

Regarding drones, the mobilization center of our province, Shenzhen Alltech and Dongguan Zhongchuang have a monthly production capacity of 80 units. It is recommended to urgently mobilize 9 companies with this production capacity, including Shenzhen Smart Drone UVA, Dongguan Zhongchuang Intelligent Equipment and Guangzhou Hopong Helicopter Remote, to cooperate and produce.

关于无人机，我省动员中心，深圳科卫泰，东莞XX（疑似洋华或阳华），月产能80架，建议紧急动员深圳智航，东莞众创，XXXXX， 广州红鹏等9家有这个生产能力的企业配合推进。

*（路德社：这些公司的暴露会让美国卫星重点关注，进而确认无人机、无人艇和相关设备的产能及产量。建议推友反复听录音，排除噪音确认企业名称。）*

&nbsp;

Regarding unmanned boats, the unmanned boat mobilization center of our province, Zhuhai Yunzhou, and Jianglong Shipbuilding have a monthly production capacity of 90 units. Both tasks can be completed on time. (Company's name to be verified)

关于无人艇，我省无人艇动员中心，珠海云洲，江龙船艇月产能可达90艘。以上两项任务均可按时完成。


&nbsp;

However, considering it may face the impact of laborers leaving and supply chain disruption. It is recommended to take the following countermeasures:

但可能面临返乡之后和供应链断裂影响，建议采取以下应对措施：

&nbsp;

First, organize designated enterprises, take measures to hold the workers staying in position, and transfer personnel of the same type from other enterprises to make up for the task gap of designated enterprises.

一，组织指定企业，采取措施，稳住在岗工人，适时从其他企业抽调同类型岗位人员，弥补指定企业的任务缺口。

&nbsp;

Second, adopt the method of purchasing from other provinces and fixed-point production, to ensure the supply of raw materials.

二，采取外省调购，定点生产保购的方式，确保原材料供应。

&nbsp;

Third, ask the transportation department, take measures such as opening up green channels to ensure all kinds of transportation. That's all.

三，部署交通运输部门，采取开辟绿色通道等方式，保障各种运输，我就汇报这些。

&nbsp;

Our province has massive networks and network technology advantages.

我省是网络大省，网络强省。

&nbsp;

According to the needs of mobilization tasks, how to choose the best among the best, and how to tap the potential energy of the network hidden in the civil field to support operations? Any thoughts?

根据动员任务需求，如何优中选优，把蕴藏在民间的网络势能发掘到支援作战？大家有什么意见？

&nbsp;

The superiors asked us to mobilize. We have 15 teams, there is currently a deficit of 6 teams in total 60 people, and 32 network experts in the industrial control system industry. Our opinion is to mobilize key high-tech companies such as QiAnXin, Huawei, Tencent to increase the corresponding allocation and meet the needs of the military.

上级要求我们动员，网络攻坚态势，守好网络空间进攻，搭好网络反制与需求团队，当前缺口6支60人，工控系统行业网络专家人才32人等，我们的意见是一方面动员集安信，华为，腾讯等重点高新企业，增进相应分配，满足部队需要。

&nbsp;

On the other hand, from China Southern Power Grid Guangdong Company, Guangzhou Metro Group and other large enterprises, an appropriate number of network experts in the industrial control system industry will be recruited.

另一方面从南方电网广东公司，广州地铁集团等大型企业，适量抽调工控系统行业网络专家。

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the three major network industry associations such as the Computer Network Security Association, the Provincial Network Security Association, and the Provincial Threat Intelligence Data Alliance will further help with their potential.

同时通过计算机网络安全协会，省网络安全协会，省威胁情报数据联盟等三大网络行业协会进一步挖掘潜力。

&nbsp;

In addition, we will work with relevant industry authorities to strengthen the monitoring, early warning and security protection of information systems in the financial, energy, electricity, transportation industries and information systems. Ensure that the security grid defense line in key areas won’t be penetrated.

此外，我们将汇同有关行业主管部门，加强对金融、能源、电力、交通行业，信息系统的监控预警安全防护。确保关键领域网格防线不失守。

&nbsp;

We must hurry up the mobilization of network support and complete the task with quality and quantity. The combat in novel-domains and capabilities also includes space support, our province has strong commercial satellite production and assembly capabilities, and Guangzhou has a full commercial aerospace industry chain.

网络支援动员，要抓紧时间，保质保量完成任务。新域新质领域还包括太空支援，我省有较强的商业卫星生产和组装能力，广州拥有商业航天全产业链。

&nbsp;

Shenzhen can find all satellite supporting companies. Can we take the initiative to use our advantages in this area to contribute to the war?

深圳市能找到所有卫星配套组件，我们能不能主动作为，利用这方面的优势为参战支前做些贡献？

&nbsp;

Commander, we currently rely on Zhuhai Obit, Shenzhen Dongfanghong, Foshan Deya and Jihua Laboratory, four satellite teams, a total of 16 low-orbit satellites, with global remote sensing 0.5 to 10 meters ultra-high optical resolution imaging capabilities.

指挥员，目前我们依托珠海欧比特，深圳东方红，佛山德雅和季华实验室，编建了四支卫星侦察分队，共有低轨卫星16颗，具备全球遥感0.5至10米超高光学分辨率成像能力。

&nbsp;

Although these resources are directly deployed by the military, the enterprises where the resources are located belong to our province, and we have a duty to ensure that these forces play a good role.

虽然这些资源由部队直接调用，但资源所在的企业归属我省，如何确保这些力量发挥好作用，我们责无旁贷。

&nbsp;

According to the coordination and docking with the troops in the early stage, I feel that there are two aspects that need to be paid attention to.

根据前期与部队协调对接，我感到有两个方面需要关注。

&nbsp;

First, take the initiative to serve the enterprises in the front, and the competent industry departments will send special personnel to the enterprises to provide services, stabilize the backbone technical personnel, and support the key bone network facilities. Make sure that the satellite data is transmitted back.

一是，主动靠前服务企业，行业主管部门派专人进驻企业定点服务，把骨干技术人员稳定住，把重点控网设施搞托底。确保卫星数据传的回收得住。

&nbsp;

Second, do a good job in the safety protection of satellite receiving stations. At present, there are four ground receiving stations in our province, including one in Zhuhai, one in Mohe in Heilongjiang, one in Wusu in Xinjiang, and one in Gaomi in Shandong. For the Zhuhai military-civilian joint command in our province, should make it an important defense target, join the joint defense system.

二是，搞好卫星接收站的安全防护，目前我省卫星共有四个地面接收站，其中珠海一个，黑龙江漠河，新疆乌苏，山东高密各一个，在我省范围的珠海市军地联合指挥所，要将其定为重要防卫目标，加入联合防卫体系。

&nbsp;

If it is distributed in other provinces, it is recommended to notify relevant provinces to pay attention through the strategic coordination group.

分布在其他省份的，建议通过《战略纲要》接收组通报相关省份予以关注。

&nbsp;

In addition, it is necessary to make preparations for emergency production during wartime, master the commercial satellite industry chain and supply chain, and work with related enterprises to do a good job in the reserve of production materials and the prefabrication of production lines.

另外还要做好战时应急生产准备，掌握好商业卫星产业链，供应链，会同相关企业有针对性的搞好生产材料的储备和生产线的预制。

&nbsp;

Once necessary, relevant departments will quickly respond and actively coordinate, shorten the approval cycle, speed up the emergency production of commercial satellites, and increase the resources of high-tech enterprises in our province.

一旦有需要，相关部门快速反应主动协调，缩短审批周期，加快商业卫星指定應急生产，提高我省高精技术企业援战贡献率。

&nbsp;

That's all.

汇报完毕。

&nbsp;

Regarding the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, the relevant departments should follow the functional division of labor and do a good job in the implementation of tasks. Let's finish this study here.

关于新域新质资源动员，相关部门要按照职能分工，抓好任务落实，几个问题我们就研究到这里。

&nbsp;
