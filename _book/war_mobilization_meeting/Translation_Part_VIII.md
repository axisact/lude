# Translation_Part_VIII

Overseas mobilization is an important support for the strategic victory against Taiwan. It is necessary to give full play to the advantages of our province having a large number of overseas Chinese immigrants from our province, many state-owned and private enterprises going abroad, and many economic and trade cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road.

海外动员是对台战略决胜的重要支撑，要充分发挥我省境外华人华侨多，走出去的国企民企多，与一带一路沿线国家经贸合作多的优势。

&nbsp;

Adopt the method of covering the army with the people and supporting the army with the people, sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, and mobilizing the purchase of high-end chips, precision machinery, special materials and other materials that are in short supply in China. As well as large quantities of strategic reserve materials such as oil, grain, minerals, etc., to solve the dilemma of the Western Alliance's pursuit and interception of strategic materials in the wartime, vigorously mobilize overseas Chinese immigrants and groups, actively participate in supporting and safeguarding our military operations, and increase the introduction of special professionals. Strive to make sure the global resources are available to us and ensure that foreign aid is effective and efficient.

采取以民掩军，以民援军的方式，隐显结合，动员购置高端芯片，精密机械，特种材料等国内紧缺物资。以及石油，粮食，矿产等大宗战略储备物资，破解战时被美西方联盟对我战略物资围追堵截的困局，大力动员海外华人华侨和团体，积极参与支援保障我军事行动，加大特殊专业人才引进力度，力求全球一切资源可为我所用，确保以外援内的有效果，有效益，有效率。

&nbsp;

Just now, the National Defense Mobilization Center reported on the implementation of the mobilization task. All units and departments should follow a clear division of responsibilities and implement them without compromise. Everyone discussed issues related to the recruitment of soldiers and the new recruits in the new domain, and it was very good.
刚才国防动员中心，汇报了动员任务落实建议，各单位，各部门要按照明确的职责分工，不打折扣，抓好落实。大家围绕兵员征召，积极支援支前新域新质动员有关问题做出了讨论，讲的很好。

&nbsp;

Political commissar Wang Shouxin  put forward very good opinions on overseas mobilization, and I agree with him. Next, I would like to emphasize three points:

王守信政委就海外动员提了很好的意见，我都同意。下面，我再强调三点：

&nbsp;

First, we must strengthen the awareness of the overall situation, gather our strength to return to unity, and contain strategic decisive victory. It is a battle of reunification, a battle of revival, which can only be successful but not failure. Order consciousness, resolutely implement, all energy, focus on the war, all work serves the war, all resources are tilted to the war, and contribute to the realization of the complete reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the nation.

第一，要强化大局意识，聚力复归一统，蕴含战略决胜，是统一之战，复兴之战，只能成功不能失败，我们要坚决贯彻党中央，中央军委决策意图，强化政治意识，全局意识，号令意识，坚决做到，全部精力，向打仗聚焦，一切工作为打仗服务，所有资源向打仗倾斜，为实现祖国完全统一，民族伟大复兴贡献广东力量。

&nbsp;

Second, we exploit our advantages and strength integrally, fully ensure to win (the war/combat). From the forefront of reform to the front line of aid, fully exploit the economic advance, largely mobilize resources with in the province and the overseas’, make the full use of the maritime potential, effectively support the combat operations of the troops, fully exploit to the advantages of the organization (communist ideology established organizations and systems), fully release the potential of new areas and new systems （and combat in novel-domains and capabilities ）, and effectively improve The combat effectiveness of the troops, fully exploit to the advantages of talents of individuals, gather think tanks in various fields to provide intellectual support for the strategic victory. (By doing all of these), this will expand the overall potential resources of our province.

第二，要发挥综合优势，全力保障打赢。从改革最前沿走向援战第一线，充分发挥经济优势，广大动员省内海外资源，用足用好海上潜力，有力支援部队作战行动，充分发挥体制优势，全面释放新域新质潜能，有效提升部队战斗力，充分发挥人才优势，集聚各领域頂尖專家智库，为战略决胜提供智力支撑。切實把我省雄厚的潜力资源轉化爲打赢之势。

&nbsp;

Third, we must resolutely complete the task and help the decisive battle. The decisive victory at all levels must be based on the most difficult and complex situations, and be fully prepared. The main leaders must stand in the front, and the front line must be supported. All departments must cooperate closely and efficiently meet the needs.

第三，要坚决完成任务， 助力决战决胜，各级要立足最困难最复杂情况，做好万全准备，主要领导要以上率下，冲锋在前，挺战一线，各部门，要密切配合，高效满足需求。

&nbsp;

We must go all out to implement it, to ensure that the recruited troops and mobilized materials will be put into the front line continuously and normally. The plan of mobilization task is done.

必须全力以赴抓好落实，确保征召的兵源，动员的物资，持续投入前线，投入正常，动员任务就筹划到这里。

&nbsp;

Next, please let Commander Zhou

下面 请周河司令员

&nbsp;

Organize research and planning, ground defense combat missions

组织研究筹划，地面防备作战任务

&nbsp;

Zhou He: Comrades!

周河：同志们

&nbsp;

Next, we will study the determination of directional ground defense operations. First, the command and control center will report the decision-making recommendations.

下面研究定向地面防卫作战决心 ，首先由指挥控制中心汇报决行建议。

&nbsp;

Commander! According to the order of the Eastern and Southern Theater Command, the ground defense operations in our province need to be organized and implemented in two situations:

指挥员！根据东部南部战区命令，我省地面防卫作战需分两种情况组织实施：

&nbsp;

The first is to participate in ground defense operations in the four cities in eastern Guangdong. Under the unified command of the Eastern Theater Command, the Guangdong Armed Police Corps. The command post was dispatched to lead the organization with 7,000 local militiamen.

第一种，是参加粤东四市地面防卫作战。在东部战区的统一指挥下，由武警广东总队
派驻指挥所牵头组织，当地基干民兵約（改为：民兵编制）7000人参加。

&nbsp;

The second is to take the lead in organizing ground defense operations in 17 cities other than eastern Guangdong, and the joint military-civilian command will take the lead in organizing them.

第二种，牵头组织，粤东以外 17个市的地面防卫作战，由本军地联合指挥部牵头组织，

&nbsp;

The distribution forces include: the Guangdong Armed Police Corps (excluding the four cities in eastern Guangdong), the sixth detachment of the Armed Police Second Mobile Corps, a mobile brigade and Coast Guard 311 Brigade, and the second militia battalion with a total of about 26,000 people.

配送力量有 ：武警广东总队 *(不含粤东四市力量)*，武警第二机动总队第六支队，现一个机动大队和海防311旅，现第二民兵团共约2.6万人。

&nbsp;

According to the plan, ground defense operations around 17 cities.

根据预案，围绕17个市地面防卫作战

&nbsp;

Among the recommendations are the following:

提出决心建议如下

&nbsp;

1、Guidance on defense
Resolutely implement the joint command center of the theater, and adhere to the combat guidance of defense before attacking, regional joint defense, comprehensive deployment and control, elite troops, combination of defense and countermeasures, and focus on protection. Strictly organize the defense of important targets in the jurisdiction, coastal guided maneuver defense, and social stability and chaos, protest the US counterattack, maintain the security of important targets, and maintain social stability. With the overall security and stability of the jurisdiction, it can effectively support the strategic decision-making against Taiwan.

坚决贯彻战区联合指挥中心，坚持未攻先防，区域联防 ，全面布控，精兵制要，防反结合，注重防护的作战指导。严密组织辖区重要目标防卫，海岸导引机动防卫，和社会维稳治乱，抗议美国打击，维护重要目标安全，维持社会稳定。以辖区总体安全稳定，有效支撑对台战略决胜。

&nbsp;

Second, the focus of defense

二，关于防卫重心

&nbsp;

According to the theater command and our province's plan, the main defense directions are determined as:

根据战区命令和我省预案，主要防卫方向确定为：

&nbsp;

Defense of Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen and Huizhou

广佛深惠方向

&nbsp;

The key defense areas are:

重点防卫区域为：

&nbsp;

Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Yangjiang area

广州，深圳，惠州，阳江地区

&nbsp;

Important defense targets include important military targets such as the theater joint operations command center and maritime operations sub-center, as well as important civilian targets such as the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and the South China Power Grid.
At the same time, we must also concentrate on effectively preventing and reducing the risk of resource cut-off and industrial breakdowns,and make more and more efforts to mobilize and counter-mobilize. Powerfully mobilize domestic and overseas people, and ensure the security of supply of important strategic materials.
重要防卫目标包括，战区联合作战指挥中心，海上作战分中心等重要军事目标，以及大亚湾核电站，华南电网等重要民事目标。

&nbsp;

Three about defense measures
三、关于防卫措施

&nbsp;

According to the plan, taking the city as a unit and according to the administrative divisions, 17 defense divisions are compiled, as well as the coastal control group, the network information protection group, the mobile combat area and the logistics support team.

根据预案，以市为单位，按照行政区划，编17个防卫分区，以及海岸管控群，网络信息防护群，机动作战群和后勤保障队。

&nbsp;

Create a land-shore connection, point-to-surface integration, flexible and defensive measures that have both defense and war. Among them, 17 cities and 17 defense divisions are composed of various militiamen, public security, emergency forces, and municipal armed police internal security detachments.

建立陆岸衔结，点面结合，灵活弹性，防战兼备的防卫措施。其中 17个市，17个防卫分区由各市民兵，公安，应急力量，及市武警内卫支队编成。

&nbsp;

The three executive detachments directly under the PAP (Armed Police Force) are assigned to the Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen defense divisions on the spot. The network information protection group and target security team remain unchanged according to the plan.

武警总队直属的三个執行支队，就地配属给广州，珠海，深圳防卫分区，海岸总动群由 海防311旅大部兵力编成。网络信息防护群和目标保障队，按方案不变。

&nbsp;

Regarding the use of other attachments, we have two options.

关于其他配属力量使用 我们有两个方案。

&nbsp;

First, concentrated use of the Armed Police Guangzhou Corps Mobile Detachment Six Armed Police Mobile Detachments, now a mobile brigade and part of the Coast Guard 311 Brigade, a total of about 6,000 people are organized into three mobile groups, deployed in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Zhanjiang. Responsible for mobile support and counter-terrorism and stability maintenance tasks in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong.

第一案，集中使用 将武警广州总队机动支队 武警机动六支队，现一个机动大队和海防311旅部分力量，共约6000人编为三个机动群，配置在深圳，广州，湛江地区。担负珠三角和粤西地区机动支援和反恐维稳任务。

&nbsp;

Second, decentralized use four brigades of the Sixth Armed Police Mobile Detachment, with about 1,600 people, were assigned to Shanwei, Huizhou, Yangjiang and Heyuan respectively.

第二案，分散使用 将武警机动六支队的四个大队约1600人，分别配属给汕尾，惠州，阳江，河源。

&nbsp;

The Coast Guard 311 Brigade's two coastal defense groups, with about 500 people carrying light weapons, were assigned to the six important military targets of Foshan and Zhanjiang. The defense tasks were heavier, and their own defense forces were weak and should be strengthened.

海防311旅两个海防群，约500人携带轻武器，分别配属给佛山，湛江。这六个单位重要军事目标，防卫任务较重，自身防卫力量较弱，应予加强。

&nbsp;

Third, the other subordinate forces of nearly 4,000 people, under the control of the headquarters, are organized into mobile combat groups, with four sub-groups, each sub-group is responsible for the mobile defense of an area, targeting the exit of the military and the large-scale riots in the Pearl River Delta.

三，其他配属力量近4000人，由指挥部掌握，编为机动作战群，设四个分群，每个分群负责一个片区机动防卫，针对军地出口，珠三角大规模骚乱事件。

&nbsp;

Fourth, with regard to defense command, relying on the provincial, municipal, and county-level military-civilian joint command organizations, the headquarters establishes a synergistic relationship with the Guangzhou coastal defense cluster, the Nanning air combat cluster, and the large-area combat maneuver support combat cluster within its jurisdiction, as well as relevant important target units.

四 ，关于防卫指挥，依托省市县三级军地结合指挥机构，指挥部与广州近海防卫集群，南宁空中作战機群，以及辖区内大区作战 机动支援作战群，相关重要目标单位建立协同关系。

&nbsp;

Fifth, the time limit for completing the preparations. It is recommended that all preparations be completed before 12:00 on May 9, 6 hours earlier than the time specified by the theater.

五，完成准备时限 建议于5月9日12时前完成各项准备，比战区明确的时间提前6小时。

&nbsp;

The report is complete!

汇报完毕！

&nbsp;

Is there anything else to add to the charge center?

指控中心还有没有什么需要补充的？

&nbsp;

I will add a report!

我补充汇报一下！

&nbsp;

When studying the defense operation plan, we mainly grasp three principles.

研究防卫作战方案时，我们主要把握三点原则。

&nbsp;

First, adhere to the overall joint defense, give full play to the joint efforts of the party, government, army, police and people, and waging a war with all the people through joint prevention and control.

一，坚持整体联防，充分发挥党政军警民整体的合力，联防联控打人民战争。

&nbsp;

Second, adhere to flexible arrangements, and on the basis of defending points and controlling surfaces, master capable forces at all levels to implement mobile support.

二，坚持弹性布置，在守住点、控住面的基础上，各级掌握精干力量实施机动支援。

&nbsp;

Third, adhere to the bottom-line thinking, fully anticipate that our key targets will be attacked by the enemy, and emergencies such as turmoil in megacities, and deploy forces to properly respond.

三，坚持底线思维，充分预想我关键性目标遭敌打击，和特大城市发生动乱等紧急情况，配屬力量妥善应对。

&nbsp;

Regarding the use of attached power, two schemes are proposed:

关于配属力量的使用，提出两个方案：

&nbsp;

First, it mainly focuses on maintaining stability and controlling chaos, especially for large-scale riots that may occur in the two megacities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the concentrated use of armed police mobile forces can quickly respond to emergencies and effectively maintain social stability.

第一，主要突出维稳治乱，特别是针对广州 深圳两个特大城市可能发生的，大规模骚乱事件，武警机动力量集中使用，可以快速应对突发事件，有效维护社会稳定。

&nbsp;

Second, it mainly focuses on the defense of important targets, deploys some of the elite forces to the above configuration, and deploys them in advance to improve the key guarding and quick counter strike capabilities of the defense divisions.

第二，主要突出重要目标防卫，把部分精锐力量，向上述配置，前置部署，提升防卫分区重点守护和快反打击能力，省本级掌握部分精锐分区支援，以快易快。

Once it is estimated that there will be riots in the Pearl River Delta region, the four mobile combat groups can quickly gather to respond.

一旦研判珠三角即將發生騷亂，四個機動作戰分群迅速收拢跟应对。


&nbsp;

We prefer the second case.
我们倾向第二案。

&nbsp;

Do you have any suggestions for the two programs proposed by the accusation center?

对于指控中心提出的两个方案，大家有什么建议？

&nbsp;

I am inclined to the first case.

我汇报下，我倾向于第一案。

&nbsp;

The reason is that the population-intensive industries in the Pearl River Delta are concentrated, and more than 80% of the resources in novel-domains and capabilities are concentrated in this area. It can be said that if the Pearl River Delta is stabilized, Guangdong will be stabilized.  Once the Pearl River Delta is in chaos, it will seriously affect the implementation of the mobilization task. and sustained mobilization. Therefore, the defense focus should be placed on the Pearl River Delta region.

理由是珠三角人口密集产业集中，80%以上的新域新质的资源都集中在这一区域，可以说，稳住了珠三角就稳住了广东，珠三角一旦生乱将严重影响动员任务落实，和持续动员能力。因此，防卫重点应放在珠三角地区。


&nbsp;

The report is complete!

汇报完毕！

&nbsp;

Commander, I prefer the second case.

指挥员我更倾向于第二案。

&nbsp;

Based on two considerations.

主要基于两点考虑。

&nbsp;

First, from the perspective of combat objectives, the core of defense operations is the defense target. Where there are many targets and where the targets are important, troops will be allocated where they are. Important targets such as airports, ports, combat positions, and nuclear power plants in the theater must be deployed with elite troops.

第一，从作战目的看，防卫作战的核心就是防卫目标，哪里目标多、哪里目标重要，兵力就往哪里配，战区明确的机场，港口，作战阵地（改为：导弹阵地），核电站等重要目标，必须精兵部署。

&nbsp;

Second, from the perspective of the threat of the enemy situation, it is mainly special warfare special attack and latent special destruction. In the second case, some of the elite forces were assigned to the defense division, and some of the elite forces were supported in the area, which was conducive to the realization of comprehensive control and the need for elite troops.

&nbsp;

第二，从敌情威脅看，主要是特战特袭和潜特破坏，特点是隐蔽突然快打快收，精兵前置才能快速反应。第二案将部分精锐力量配属给防卫分区，部分精干力量区域支援，有利于实现全面布控，精兵制要。

&nbsp;

The report is complete!

汇报完毕！

&nbsp;

Commander, I am leaning towards the first case!

指挥员，我倾向于第一案！

&nbsp;

There are two reasons

理由有两点

&nbsp;

First, it is convenient to concentrate superior forces for mobile support, and the command headquarters can directly grasp more superior forces, which is convenient for dealing with the uncertainty of defense operations.

一，便于集中优势兵力机动支援，指挥部直接掌握更多的优势力量，便于应对防卫作战的不确定性，在多方向出现紧急情况时，兵力使用选择余地更大。

&nbsp;

Second, it is convenient to maintain social stability in megacities. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, a certain scale of troops are stationed together to facilitate the formation of deterrence, and they can be dealt with quickly in case of situations.

二，便于维护特大城市社会稳定，在广州，深圳集中驻扎一定规模兵力，便于形成威慑，遇有情况也能迅即处置。


&nbsp;

The report is complete!

汇报完毕！

&nbsp;

Do other comrades have any additional comments?

其他同志还有没有补充意见？

&nbsp;

Okay, everyone has talked a lot about this issue. Does the command and control center have any difficulty in defending nuclear power plant equipment and high-risk sensitive targets?

好的，对于这个问题大家都谈了很好的信息，指挥控制中心对于核电站设备，对于核电站这类高危敏感目标的防卫有没有什么困难？

&nbsp;

commander! There are four nuclear power plants in Daya Bay, Ling'ao, Taishan and Yangjiang in our province, which are respectively under the responsibility of Shenzhen, Jiangmen and Yangjiang security divisions.

指挥员！我省境共内有大亚湾，岭澳，台山，阳江四座核电站，分别由深圳，江门，阳江防卫分区负责。

&nbsp;

The difficulty for nuclear power plants is how to rescue them in the event of a leak. We consider that, in general, rescue operations are organized on-site and off-site separately. On-site is organized by the self-sustaining force of the nuclear power plant, and various defense divisions are responsible for the off-site. If necessary, ask the relevant national professional rescue forces for support.

对于核电站的难点是，一旦发生泄漏如何救援的问题，我们考虑，总体上救援行动区分场内场外分别组织，场内由核电站自身力量组织，场外由各防卫分区組織组织力量负责。必要时请示国家相关专业救援力量支援。

&nbsp;

The report is complete!

汇报完毕！

&nbsp;

Besides the cities, what other nuclear defense forces are there at the provincial level?

除各市之外，省本级、其它还有什么核防卫救援力量？

&nbsp;

commander! There are also radiation environment monitoring, nuclear and biochemical support, and biochemical medical testing in the Guangzhou area, but the overall scale is small.

指挥员！广州地区还有辐射环境监测，核生化救援，生化医疗检测（加：等组织分区），三支隊伍总体规模较小。

&nbsp;

Answered!

回答完毕！

&nbsp;

Okay, this is the end of the study. Vice Governor Zhizhong, do you have any comments on the defense operations?

好的，这个问题研究到这里，志中副省长你对防卫作战有什麽什麽意见沒有沒有？

&nbsp;

Wang Zhizhong: （Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province，Director of the Provincial Public Security Department ) 

王志中：副省长，省公安厅厅长

&nbsp;

We will organize the public security forces to fully participate, about the Military-civilian joint defense I have no other opinions!

我们将组织公安力量全力参加，軍警民聯防没有其它意见！

&nbsp;

Okay, what else do you think about the commissar of defense operations?

好的，政委对于防卫作战你还有什么考虑？

&nbsp;

Wang Shouxin:

王守信：

&nbsp;

I have two comments

我讲两点意见

&nbsp;

First, strengthen the protection of the political field. Judging from the recent local wars, especially the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and the West will try their best to slander and smear me, try to confuse right and wrong, and shake my will to win a just and decisive battle. We must give full play to the legal struggle of public opinion, psychology and the role of the militia team, strengthen the guidance of public opinion and psychological protection, and gather the positive energy of patriotism and support of the army.

一是，加强政治领域防护，从近几场局部战争，特别是俄乌冲突战争情况看，站在大气候，美西方必极力对我污蔑，抹黑，妄图混淆是非，动摇我軍民軍民决战决胜意志。对此要充分发挥舆论与法理斗争和心理攻防民兵队伍的作用，加强公众舆论引导和心理防护，凝聚爱国拥军支前的正能量。

&nbsp;

Second, give full play to the advantages of people's war, fully absorb the experience of epidemic prevention and control in previous years, fully mobilize grass-roots organizations, widely mobilize cadres and the masses, organize military, police and civilian forces, carry out grid management and control, create an atmosphere for the whole people to prepare for war, and improve the people's endurance to bear war disasters , so that the enemy's spy has no place to hide.

&nbsp;

二是，要发挥人民战争优势，充分吸取前些年疫情防控经验，充分动员基层组织，广泛发动干部群众，组织军警民力量，展开网格化管控，营造全民备战氛围，提高民众战灾承受能力，让敌特无藏身之处。

&nbsp;

Governor, do you have any other comments here?

省长，你这边还有没有其它意见？

&nbsp;

Wang Weizhong：

王伟中：

&nbsp;

No opinion, please make up your mind commander!
没有意见，请司令员定下决心！

&nbsp;

Just now, the Command and Control Center put forward suggestions for defense operations, and everyone expressed their opinions from different aspects. According to the orders of the Sub-center of the Southern Theater Command and the actual situation of our province, my determination for the defense operations is as follows:

&nbsp;

刚才，指控中心提出了防卫作战建议，大家从不同方面发表了自己意见，根据南部战区用兵陆上作战分中心的命令，结合我省实际，我对防卫作战决心如下：

&nbsp;


1、Regarding defense guidance, in principle, I agree with the command and control center's suggestion. The ground defense operations in the southern theater should basically be supported by land stability to support the main battlefield in the Taiwan Strait. Specifically, our province should grasp two points.

一，关于防卫指导，原则上同意指挥控制中心的建议，南部战区地面防卫作战，根本指導是以陆域稳定支撑策应台海主战场，具体到我省要把握两点

&nbsp;

1、 Ensure the safety of important targets, ensure the stability of the joint combat system, support the Taiwan Strait and deny enemy annihilation operations.

1、确保重要目标安全，保障联合作战体系稳定，支撑策应台海和拒止前敌作战。

&nbsp;

2、 Maintain social stability, maintain mobilization potential, and provide strong support for the South Wing of Taiwan, with the overall security and stability of the jurisdiction.

2、维护社会稳定，保持动员潜力以辖区总体安全稳定，有力支撑台海南翼策应主侧翼主戰場。

&nbsp;

Second, regarding the important defense areas, in addition to Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, and Yangjiang, the Zhanjiang area has important targets such as Zhanjiang Port, Suining Airport, and radar stations, which are the key areas in the South China Sea to deny the frontline enemy forces, and they must also be heavily defended.

二，关于重要防卫区域，除了广州，深圳，惠州，阳江外，湛江地区有湛江港，遂宁机场，雷达站等重要目标，是南海方向拒止前敌兵力的重点区域，也要重点防卫。

&nbsp;

Third, with regard to the deployment of defense and the use of active-duty forces.

三，关于防卫部署，配储现役力量的使用。

&nbsp;

In principle, I agree with the second plan. The clear and important goals of the theater are related to the stability of the joint combat system. It is necessary to control the forces and ensure security. While the mobile combat forces are supported by divisions, they must be prepared for the deployment of troops and centralized handling of emergencies. 

原则上我同意第二个方案，战区明确的重要目标关系到联合作战体系稳定，必须要精兵控要，确保安全，机动作战力量在分区支援的同时，要做好兵力抽动集中处置突发情况准备。

&nbsp;

In addition, make two adjustments.

另外再做两个方面调整。

&nbsp;

First, the use of nuclear rescue forces. The province's nuclear rescue forces are limited. On the basis of relying on Shenzhen, Jiangmen, and Yangjiang's own strengths, we should organize professional forces in the Guangzhou area, compile them into nuclear rescue forces, and coordinate rescue needs in Guangzhou. Implement mobile rescue, and at the same time add nuclear experts to the command center to provide assistance in decision making for rescue operations.

第一，核化救援力量的使用，全省核救援力量有限，在依托深圳，江门，阳江自身力量基础上，要把广州地区组织五支专业力量，编为核化救援群，配置在广州统筹全省救援需要，实施机动救援，同时指挥内部要增设核化专家，为救援行动提供輔助决策。

&nbsp;

Second, the use of network protection forces, in principle, the network protection is mainly responsible for the own security team. The provincial network information protection group will provide support, and the support force must be strengthened.

第二，网络防护力量的使用，原则上网络防护要以自身安防团队为主负责。省网络信息防护群进行支援，这支力量一定要增强。

&nbsp;

In addition to the support of the technical support team of the service organization, the preparation of network experts should be added to provide support for the preparation of network security incidents.
除编组的技术支援分队以外，还要增加网络专家團隊，为网络安全事件处置提供护送支持。

&nbsp;

For other content, I agree with the suggestion of the accusation center.

其它内容，我同意指控中心的建议。

&nbsp;

After the meeting, according to the spirit of the meeting, organize and report our province's determination to mobilize and fight for defense. Dismissed!

会后，迅速根据会议精神，整理上报我省动员决心和防卫作战决心。散会！

&nbsp;

According to the deployment of the provincial military-civilian joint headquarters, and the military-civilian joint headquarters of each city held a symposium to understand the task, develop intelligence, and coordinate the upper and lower levels to plan synchronously.


根据省军地联合指挥部部署，各市军地联合指挥所召开座谈会，理解任务，研判情报，上下联动，同步展开筹划。

&nbsp;

报告首长，全会完毕！

Report to the head, the plenary session is over!
