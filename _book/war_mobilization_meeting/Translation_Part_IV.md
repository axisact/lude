&nbsp;

However, in the implementation of the mobilization task, the following two aspects also need to be highly focused on.

但在项目动员任务落实过程中，以下两个方面还需要重点关注。

&nbsp;

the recruitment of soldiers issue. The recruitment of 15,500 soldiers need to be completed in one month, especially the first batch of 2,500 soldiers. The time to achieve this recruitment is very urgent.

&nbsp;

2、the mobilization of maritime support, mainly due to the heavy tasks of all kinds of ship-weaponization, the high-quality rate of crew members during wartime, there are still some compatible issues about adaptation rate *(适配率)* of equipments. The report is complete.

2、是海上支援动员，主要是各类船舶项目任务重，战时随船人员质优率，装备设备适配率还有些矛盾问题。汇报完毕。

&nbsp;

Just now, the National Defense Mobilization Center reported on the implementation of the mobilization task. The task is basically clear, and the key is whether it can be implemented. These two high focus issues are particularly important. Any additional comments?

刚才，国防动员中心汇报了动员任务落实建议，任务基本明确，关键是能不能落下去。需要关注的两个问题非常重要，大家还有什么补充意见？

&nbsp;

I will make an additional statement on coordinating the implementation of strategic resources at the national level.

我就协调落实国家层面战略资源做个补充发言。

&nbsp;

The National Mobilization Committee has made it clear that the national strategic resources within Guangdong Province will be given an unified order of recruitment by the National Mobilization Committee and the Strategic Direction Coordination Group *(战略方向协调组)*. To clear the mobilization task.

国家国动委明确，广东省范围内的国家层面的战略资源由国家国动委及战略方向协调组統一下达征召令，明确动员任务。

&nbsp;

Our province is responsible for coordinating and implementing the work of gathering, grouping, refitting, transporting and handing over works/tasks. This task has many coordination links and a long implementation chains.

我省负责协调落实资源的集结、编组、改装、输送、交接的工作。这项任务协调环节多，落实链又长。

&nbsp;

For example, 10,000-ton ro-ro ships, it has to cooperate with the national shipping authority to recruit and weaponized plans, and at the same time need to organize the formation of on-board militia for each ship, equip ships with weapons, and organize transportation and handover.

比如万吨级的滚装船，既要配合国家航运主管部门搞好征集和加改装，又要为船舶快速组织编组船上民兵，配备武器装备，还要组织输送和交接。

&nbsp;

We must stand at the overall picture,  and earnestly complete this task. It is suggested that in accordance with the principles of unified decision-making, graded implementation, and industry-specific guidance, the relevant provincial industry departments guide each city, and each of you must concentrate on the implementation of the above tasks .

我们要站在全局高度，切实把这项任务抓好。建议按照统一决策，分级落实，分行业指导的原则，由省相关行业主管部门指导各市，各自抓好任務落实。

&nbsp;

In addition, in recent years, combat in novel-domains and capabilities 
of our province has developed rapidly.I see that there are many needs in the tasks proposed by the troops, and we should also pay attention to the implementation of this part of the tasks.


另外，近几年，我省新域新质动员力量建设发展很快，我看部队提出的任务里边，这方面的需求也很多，我们也要关注这部分任务的落实。

&nbsp;
