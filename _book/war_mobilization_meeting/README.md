## 路德社点评

此录音内容是中共自建政以来第一次如此高级别的军事秘密部署会议录音被获取公开，史无前例，是中共军方高层人士宁愿暴露自己，冒着被军法处置的结局，也要向文明世界传递中共习近平的邪恶计划。

会议时间为北京时间2022年5月14日，公布时间为纽约时间2022年5月14日，首次公布为路德社。

此次情报的获取是路德社与中共内部潜在的军方等众多高层神秘力量（代号雷）一起策划之后，获得的。该录音被公布之后，让习近平当局恐慌，在内部掀起“宁可错杀一千，也不放过一个”的挖内奸大行动。

该录音中共军方用大量军事用语代号，将习近平当局对台湾海峡，南中国海，东中国海，跨越到第一岛链，最终与美国战略决胜的具体行动策划显露出来，对分析中共军方“人民战争”的战略战术的理解具有重要价值！

The following audio recording is the very first time such a top secret military meeting has been recorded, obtained and made public since the founding of the PRC in 1949.

It's from a group of senior members of the Chinese Communist Party military who risked their own lives to expose the evil plan of Xi Jinping and the CCP to the civilized world.

The meeting was held on May 14, 2022 Beijing time, and was first published on May 14, 2022 New York time, by Lude Media.

This intelligence operation was planned and carried out by Lude Media along with our allies within the CCP(code name: Thunder) , especially the military. Xi Jinping administration panicked after the audio recording was made public and launched an internal task to hunt "Thunder", saying that “Thunder” has to be captured and eliminated at all costs.

The recording, which is coded with a series of military terms, reveals the Xi Jinping administration's detailed plans for the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, the East China Sea and to cross the First Island Chain, eventually to achieve a strategic victory against the United States. It also provides significant value to understand the PLA's "People's war" from both strategic and tactical ways.
