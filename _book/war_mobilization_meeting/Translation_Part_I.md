&nbsp;

Three suggestions based on the mission and tasks of Guangdong Province.

基于广东使命任务提三条建议

&nbsp;

One, immediately establish a military and non-military *(the local government of the garrison)* unification and cooperation command system

一，迅速构建军地联合指挥体系

&nbsp;

Second, the integration of the mobilization of strategic preparation for victory

二，统筹做好战略决胜动员准备

The focus of the Taiwan Strait is: Replenish sources of troops, frontline momentum protection and guarantee, armors and logistics protection, air and sea route protection, and guaranteed successful island landing

台海方向重点是：补兵源、保前推、保装载、保航渡、保登岛

The focus of the South China Sea is: Patching blind spots, maintaining rights and interests, supporting transportation, guarding islands and reefs, and controlling sea territory.

*(Cooperate with the Taiwan Strait war, increase the surveillance area in the South China Sea area, and use the civil transformation vessels to support the military defense and South China sea area control of the islands and reefs in the South China Sea by using the maritime defense. At the same time, must do good support for  transport of people and goods to the Taiwan Sea.)*

南海方向重点是：补盲区、维权益、援运输、护岛礁、控海域

*(展开说，配合台海作战，在南海地区增加监视区域，利用民间改造船只利用海上维权方式保护南海岛礁的军事防卫和海域控制。同时要做好对台海的运输保障工作。)*

As such, I believe we should direct base on needs, combination of unified and diversified, grasp the differences, and do a good job of strategic decisive mobilization pre-preparation in an integrated approach

据此，我认为应当按照需求主导、统分结合、把握差异、精准施策的思路办法，统筹做好战略决胜动员支前准备

&nbsp;

Third, prominent transformation of combat in novel-domains and capabilities potential, to focus on effectively making up for the inadequacy of the military, insist on placing scientific and technological mobilization in a prominent position to mobilize support for front-line preparations.,by the provincial military district in conjunction with the relevant authorities to further explore the conversion the abilities of proper detection and early warning, strengthen the cyber attack and defense, search and rescue, cross-sea delivery the combat in novel-domains and capabilities that is urgently needed for the decisive battle, ensure that the very optimal resources and guarantee the strategic final victory.

Adhere to the idea of while ensuring support for the frontline of the war, ensure the military-civil security and stability at same time. Improve prevention of any incident and full control of society activities with tight monitoring and strict enforcement.

按照一手保前线，一手抓稳定的思路，从严从紧，搞好社会防控。

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I would like to propose one additional point：Adhere to the idea of one hand to protect the front line, the other hand to grasp the stability of ideology, strict and tight, Improve prevention and control of social stabilization, start the Party, government, military, police and civilian joint defense and control mechanism, and particular measures for wartime control.Use the experience and practices gained from the prevention and control of the Covid-19 pandemic in previous years as a means of converting wartime social prevention and control initiatives.

&nbsp;

Fellow comrades,strategic decisive victory is not only a matter of national rejuvenation and the future fate of our country, but also impact on the world's strategic pattern. Therefore, the implementation of the transition of the peacetime to wartime is a key step in winning the overall national war, the overall political war, and the people's war of the new era, and must be seized.

同志们，战略决胜，事关民族复兴伟业，关乎国家前途命运，影响世界战略格局，实施平戰转换，是打赢国家总体战，全局政治戰战，和新时代人民战争的关键之举，必须抓紧抓好。

&nbsp;

First, to unify the ideological understanding, reinforcing the self-awareness of peacetime to wartime transition , do not hesitate to fight, crush the Taiwan independence movement and strong enemy plot, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, is the Party Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping comprehensive international and domestic two big situation, the overall situation of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation strategy, evaluate the situation to make a major strategic decision.

第一，要统一思想认识，强化转得自觉，不惜一战，粉碎台独和强敌图谋，坚决捍卫国家主权和领土完整，是党中央，习近平总书记统筹国际国内两个大局、统筹中华民族伟大复兴战略全局，审时度势作出的重大战略决策。

We must consciously strengthen the Guangdong responsibilities, with a high degree of political judgment, political comprehension, political executive, the ideological and operational unity to the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission's decisions and deployments,collective purpose from a fortress, support guarantee, strategic victory, to ensure that the mission is not humiliated, to live up to the important trust.

我们要自觉强化广东担当，以高度的政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力，把思想和行动统一到党中央、中央军委的决策部署上来，众志成城，支援保障，战略决胜，确保不辱使命，不负重托。

&nbsp;

Second, to do a good job of organizing command, clarify peacetime transfer to wartime reasonably, just now, comrade Zhou He, comrade Wang Shouxin proposed the idea to establish a military-civilian joint headquarters, I agree with the establishment of the command party committee, will be reported to the higher party committee for approval in accordance with the provisions. All industries in the province special command post, to resolutely obey the unified command of the joint command, the military and various departments at all levels, both to their respective duties and to work closely together to ensure that the party, government, military, police and civilians together, combined forces to win.

第二，要统好组织指挥，明确转得合理，刚才，周河同志，王守信同志分别提出了开设军地联合指挥部，成立指挥部党委的意见，我都同意，按规定报上级党委审批。省各行业专项指挥所，要坚决服从联合指挥部的统一指挥，军地各级各部门，既要各司其职又要密切协同，确保党政军警民一起联动，合力制胜。

&nbsp;

Third, we must coordinate and grasp, coordinate and promote the implementation, enhance the turn to win, in the overall plot, to accurately grasp, the rhythm, scope and intensity of the peacetime and wartime transition , both to fully protect the needs of the troops, support front-line operations, but also consider the lives of the majority, to ensure the security of the home front.

第三，要统筹把握，统筹推进落实，提升转得制胜，总体谋划上，要精准把握，平战转换的节奏、范围和强度，既全力保障部队所需，支援前线作战，也兼顾群众生活，确保后方稳固。

In the mobilization focus, to coordinate the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea two directions, to improve the security of the sea and land region, the use of traditional and new type two forces, the province and overseas two resources, focus on the concentration of resources to protect the security of the Taiwan Strait direction.

动员重心上，要统筹台海与南海两个方向，海上与陆上两域保障，传统新式两個力量，省内与海外两种资源，聚焦聚力资源保障台海方向。

组织实施上，要统筹经济发达城市与相对落后地区，一般行业领域与重点行业领域，确保高效有序转入战时体制。

&nbsp;

Fourth, we must unify the wartime management, stabilize the bottom line of transition, and to firm up the bottom-line thinking, closely following the actual situation that there are many people and factories and enterprises from outside of our province, we should strictly prevent the tide of financial run, the tide of factory evacuation and the tide of migrant workers returning home.Closely related to the province's strategic channels, more important objectives of the actual, we should guarantee the road protection, target defense and other work, to prevent enemy struck and attacked.Close to our province’s border with Hong Kong and Macao and long sea defenses, we must carefully guard against enemy invasion and sabotage, to prevent the use of Hong Kong to disrupt China, to disrupt the war, etc.

第四，要统住战时管理，稳固转的底线，要树牢底线思维，紧贴我省外來人口多、工厂企业多的实际，严防金融挤兑潮，工厂撤离潮，民工返乡潮；要紧贴我省战略通道多，重要目标多的实际，严密做好保障护路、目标防卫等工作，严防敌打击袭扰；要紧贴我省毗邻港澳，海防线长的实际，严防敌渗透破坏，以港乱中，以乱扰战等等。

&nbsp;

In short, we should take multiple measures and adopt a combination of measures to ensure the stability of the population and order and the home front.

总之，要多措并举，多管齐下，确保稳住人心，稳住秩序，稳住后方。

After the meeting, the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee issued the minutes of the meeting, suggesting that all departments should immediately set up a military-civilian joint headquarters and a combat command post in accordance with the meeting's deployment, make specific plans for deployment, and organize the transformation of the province from peace to war.
