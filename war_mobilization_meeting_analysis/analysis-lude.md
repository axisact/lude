# 路德社点评

这是解放军(PLA)东部战区与南部战区给广东省军区下达战前动员高层秘密会议录音，为顶级机密的情报，在中国的保密期为十年，在新华网等中共官媒是找不到的。路德社之前所爆出的情报都是听完类似这次的录音后在节目里复述，今天是第一次播放原始录音情报。之前武汉“9.18行动”军演会议与西安出血热军演会议的实况与此次会议类似。所有情报均指向习近平是一个愚蠢且刚愎自用的人，之前路德社对他的爆料也来自他和其身边人的录音，智力正常的人觉得疯狂或不可行的事情，在习近平看来是可以做的。所以该录音显示的中国备战情况是习近平为了即将发动的战争而做的战前动员。此次会议针对的是跟广东相邻的台海与南海军事战略布局，分为四个部分：

This is a recording of a high-level confidential pre-war mobilization meeting between the PLA's Eastern and Southern Theater Command to the Guangdong Military Region, this kind of classified intelligence that will remain classified for ten years in China. All official media in CCP had no chance to access the content of the meeting. The intelligence that previously revealed by Lude was recounted after listening to recordings similar to this one, include the intelligence of the Wuhan military exercise meeting called "Operation 9.18" and the Xi'an Hemorrhagic fever military exercise meeting, and today is the first time the original recorded information has been played in public.
Lude has also listened to all the recorded conversations of Xi Jinping himself and those close to him, and all the evidence indicates that Xi Jinping is a stupid and self-opinionated man. Things that people of ordinary intelligence find insane or unworkable, Xi Jinping is firmly convinced that it can be done by him.
Thus the Chinese war preparations revealed in this recording are Xi Jinping's pre-war mobilization for the coming war. The conference was aimed at the strategic military layout of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, which are adjacent to Guangdong. Divided into four sections：

## 第一部分

按照“中央军委—广东省委—南部战区—广东省军区”的指示，逐级传达命令、领会精神和任务，并发布动员令。

Part 1: Follow the instructions of "Central Military Commission of the People’s Republic of China - Guangdong Provincial Party Committee - Southern Theater Command - Guangdong Military Region" to transmit the instruction of the command level-by-level, fully comprehend the spirit and assignment and the issue mobilization command.

广东省已经全面展开了“平战转换”（即由平时转为战时）工作，预示着后面的工作都是以战时状态为主。在中共的体制里，战区相当于野战部队的体系，省军区在战前负责国防动员民兵，也就是调动“军民融合”中“民”的资源。录音里讲的就是如何把广东省民间的资源转化成战时的资源。

Guangdong Province has already launched full-scale work of "transition from peacetime to wartime" (that is, Guangdong Province is into a state of war), which indicates that the following work will be dominated by wartime conditions. In the Chinese Communist Party system, the war zones are equivalent to the battlefield force system, and the provincial military regions are responsible for mobilizing the local militia before the war, which means mobilizing the resources of the " civilian" in the "military-civilian fusion". The recording is talking about how to transfer the civilian resources of Guangdong Province into wartime resources.

1、结合“迅速成立军地联合指挥部党委”，“启动党政军警民联防联控机制，和战时管控特别措施”意味着军管状态取代了现在和平时代的社会秩序。

1、With " rapidly establish a joint military-civil command party committee ", " initiate the Party - Government - Military - Police and Civilian joint defense and control mechanism, and Wartime Special Supervision System " It means that the Military control has replaced the present peacetime social order.

2、“确保高效有力转入战时体制”意味着这次大会就是广东省工作转入战时体制的动员大会。

2、"Ensure high efficient and effective transition from peacetime to wartime mechanism" designated this meeting as a marker of the full transition from peacetime to the wartime mechanism in Guangdong Province.

3、结合“把前些年新冠疫情防控的经验做法，转化为战时社会防控的举措”，这里提到的“把工作中心从抓经济发展调整到保战略决胜上来”就意味着进入军管状态，所有的封城和封控都是为了战时，之前强制清零防疫政策下的封控都是中共的障眼法（眼药水）；同样，北韩目前的疫情和防疫封控也是为了全面转入战时体制，这是路德社根据情报做出的判断。

3、Using the experience and practices accumulated in the prevention and control of the Covid-19 in previous years as an initiative for social prevention and control in wartime. Here also mentioned "to adjust the focus of work from grasping economic development to ensure strategic victory" means to enter the state of military control all the lockdown and the restrictions are for the purpose of warfare. Therefore, the previous city lockdown and restrictions under the compulsory “zero-tolerance” strategy was CCP’s smokescreen. Similarly, North Korea's current prevention and restriction measure due to the outbreak of Covid-19 is also aimed at a full transition from peacetime to a wartime mechanism , a judgment made based on intelligence by Lude Media.

4、“分析比对我省潜力资源，对动员方案进行了修订完善”的三个方面意味着广东省的经济已经进入战时状态，当进入战时状态后，所有的经济活动都是靠军事命令来指挥，和平时期的经济与市场交易行为将会失效。

4、The three aspects of "analyzing and assessing our province's potential resources and revising and completing the mobilization strategy" mean that the economy of Guangdong Province has entered a wartime state, and when it enters a wartime state, all economic activities are conducted by military directives, and economic and trade activities during the peacetime will become non-functional.

5、“组织实施上，要统筹经济发达城市与相对落后地区，一般行业领域与重点行业领域”，明确要求高科技企业“转产”，“转产”就是转向导弹生产，“扩产”就是西安等地大量生产导弹，俄罗斯的导弹都是中国生产的，这些都是路德社之前根据内部人士提供的中共中央军委的情报获悉的，现在转产、扩产的任务落到了广东省军委。廉价的产品交给“监狱产业链”生产，高端的产品转产作为军备。

5、" Regarding the organization and implementation, it is necessary to coordinate economically developed cities and relatively backward areas, general industry fields and major industry fields", and to explicitly mandate high-tech enterprises to " convert and expand the production". The "conversion" refers to the shift to missile production, and the "expansion" refers to the large-scale production of missiles in Xi'an and other cities, all of which Lude Media had gained from insider intelligence provided by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, which also mentioned that Russian missiles are produced in China. The mission to convert and expand production now landed on the Guangdong Provincial Military Commission. We have implemented the strategy of giving cheap products to the "prison industries" and diverting high-end products to military supplies.

6、强调民企向军企的转化要“转得自觉”，不自觉的就要抓起来；“不惜一战，粉碎台独和强敌图谋”中“强敌”就是指美国，体现出解放军的战略意图不只有台湾，还有美国。中共正在全面加速备战，但他们不会在短时间内以“军事化武力攻台”，这会是一场全面隐藏在老百姓背后的隐秘之战。

6、Emphasizes the conversion of civilian enterprises to military enterprises should be " self-conscious " and voluntary. " Do not spare a battle to crush Taiwan's independence and the intentions of powerful enemies", the "powerful enemies" refers to the United States. This implies that the strategic ambitions of the PLA  are not limited to Taiwan, but also the United States. The Chinese Communist Party is accelerating its preparations for war, but they will not attack Taiwan by "militarized force" very soon. It will be a war without weapons, it will be a war that is initiated by  hidden force among the ordinary people.

7、广东省委书记李希在会上亲口承认中国有产业链断裂的风险，意味着中共高层早已得知中美会彻底脱钩。郭文贵就是中共“海外动员”的力量。2021.11.17路德社开始揭露习近平的人设和其称帝的野心及计划，短短半年时间，习近平为了称帝的军事部署计划已经下达到广东省军区这样的地方部门了。路德社在第一时间把顶级机密的情报传出来就是要让更多的普通人知道真相，并为自己提前做好打算。

7、Li Xi ,Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, personally confirmed that China is at risk of cutting-off the industrial chain at the meeting, implying that the top leadership of the CCP has already been aware of the complete decoupling of China and the United States.

8、会议提到“要紧贴我省毗邻港澳，海防线长的实际，严防敌渗透破坏，以港乱中，以乱扰战”，这印证了中共对路德社会员、中国人《独立宣言》运动的参与人马某某(YA YA)的终身监禁就是为了“严防敌渗透破坏”；中共提前控制香港，让警察出身的李家超担任特首就是为了严防“以港乱中，以乱扰战”，这些做法都是为了中国的维稳，以期减少解放军对台、对美作战时的干扰。在中国只有国家主席有权宣布全国进入战争状态、启动战争动员，很显然广东省军区的战前动员大会是接到了习近平命令，全国进入战争状态意味着要把中国所有的人力、财力和物力都用在战争上面。在战时状态下，近期发生在中国的事情就可以理解为是战争动员手段，比如：撤离中资企业、限制中国人出入境、征兵以及严格管控中国人日常生活的重要物资。接下来的战争动员手段还会包括在备战重点省市实施封城、宵禁和限制人口移动；加强媒体审查，甚至断网；四处搜捕“间谍”，甚至反战人士，全民都被中共绑架。

8、The meeting mentioned that “close to our province’s border with Hong Kong and Macao and long sea defenses, we must carefully guard against enemy invasion and sabotage, prevent the intention of using  Hong Kong to disrupt China, to disrupt the launched warfare. The CCP's sentence of life imprisonment for Mr. Ma  (Twitter name: YA YA), a participant in the Chinese "Declaration of Independence" movement, is a harsh example of guarding against enemy invasion and sabotage. Moreover, for the purpose of controlling Hong Kong more quickly, the Chinese Communist Party made Li Jiachao, a police officer, the Chief Executive to prevent "using Hong Kong to disrupt China and to disrupt the launched warfare". These practices are all for China's stability maintenance and eliminating interference and disruption during the PLA's attacks on Taiwan and the United States. In China, only Xi Jinping has the authority to declare a state of war and initiate war mobilization. It is obvious that the pre-war mobilization meeting of the Guangdong military region was ordered by Xi Jinping, and that a war state means all of China's personnel, financial and material resources are to be deployed and spent for war. Therefore, recent events happened in China, such as the evacuation of Chinese companies, restrictions on the entry and exit of Chinese, military recruitment, and restrictions on essential materials for the daily lives of the Chinese are all means of war mobilization. The next war mobilization tactics will include city lockdowns, curfews, and restrictions on population movement in the major war preparation provinces and cities; increased media censorship and even cut off internet access; and take up for "spies" or even anti-war individuals, the entire population has been in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.

## 第二部分

设军地联合指挥部和作战指挥所，具体筹划部署，组织展开全省平战转换工作的任务完成情况。会议跳过了平战转化启动的演练。
Part 2: Setting up a joint military-civil command center and combat command post, which will be specifically planned and deployed for the mission of the peace/war transition of the province. The meeting skipped the rehearsal of the startup of the transition from peacetime to wartime.

1、广东省已于2022年4月18日18时完成军地各级指挥机构开设。指挥机构编成包括：编省军地联合指挥部，南海方向指挥所，和若干专项动员指挥所。“专项指挥所依托军地有关部门和行业系统，组建人民防空，交通动员，国民经济动员，舆论宣传，维稳治乱等十二个专项指挥所”意味着在未来的战时状态下，和平时期的国家机器将不再起作用，一切司法和行政的权力都归于各地指挥机构，中国人即将进入军管状态。

1、Guangdong Province has completed the establishment of military-civil command center and ground command units by 18:00 on April 18, 2022. The command structure is organized into the provincial military-civilian joint headquarters, the South China Sea Battle command post, and several special task mobilization command posts. 
“The dedicated command posts rely on the relevant military-civil industrial systems to have twelve sommand posts, including civil air defense, logistic mobilization, national economic mobilization, public propaganda, and safeguarding social stability and preventing chaos. “These words imply that in the future during wartime, the government machinery in the peacetime state will no longer work, and all judicial and administrative powers will be under the local joint military-civil command center. At which time the Chinese will be put into a state of military control.

2、会议中提到的“军委联指中心至战区联指中心，至省市县军地联合指挥机构指挥信息链路；主要依托战区联合作战指挥信息系统、机要远程递送系统、融入联合作战体系”，暴露出解放军的通信系统还处于非常落后的水平，还停留在1979年中越战争时期，比如“机要远程递送系统”就是指用人去传送情报。“融入联合作战体系”是指解放的通信系统要从传统的用电话和人去传递情报的基础上加入互联网的使用。正是由于落后的情报传送系统，才让路德社有机会拿到众多中国的机密情报。

2、The conference mentioned “establish the command information link from the Joint Command Center of the Military Commission to the Joint Command Center of the theater, as well as to the provincial, municipal and county military joint command institutions; mainly rely on the joint combat command information system of the theater, and integrate the secret information remote delivery system into the joint combat system.” revealing that the communication system of the PLA is still stuck at a very out-dated level that was used during the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979. For which “the secret information remote delivery system” refers to the use of people to deliver intelligence. And that integrating  these legacy communication systems into the joint combat warfare, means that the PLA’s communication system has to use the internet to deliver intelligence by phone and people. It was because of this out-dated system of intelligence transmission that so much Chinese top-classified intelligence can be captured and delivered to Lude Media.

3、会议中提到的“军委国防动员部至省军区领导管理信息链路，主要依托509+平台”，“省市县军地联合指挥机构至任务部分队指挥通讯链路，主要依托超短波、天宫一号卫星电话，建立动中通机动通信”，以及“军队至地方指挥通讯链路，依托宏基电子政务内网机要密码系统相互通联”，暴露出解放军的联合作战指挥体系看似很强大，其实都是过度包装，比如军委国防动员部至省军区领导管理信息链路所依靠的“509+平台”其实是基于二战时期的技术；其次，“依托超短波、天宫一号卫星电话，建立动中通机动通信”就是解放军省市县军地联合指挥机构至任务部分队指挥通讯链路所依托的技术支持，其中“动中通”是指能够在行驶的军事车辆中进行通信；此外，军队至地方指挥通讯链路依托的“宏基电子政务内网机要密码系统”也非常脆弱，开战后会很快陷入瘫痪状态。这次广东省军区开会所使用的“快捷会议系统”还是民用机别的，质量很低，体现出解放军通信系统与作战指挥系统的落后水平。这些情报暴露了解放军的作战指挥体系还是非常落后的，通讯系统没有设置冗余，跟美国的作战指挥体系存在明显的代差，这让自由世界有信心击败中。

3、The conference mentioned that "the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the provincial military district leadership management information mainly relies on the 509+ platform". "The command communication link from the provincial - city - county and military joint command units, mainly relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite phones, to establish mobile communications in motion", and "the military to local command communication link, relying on the Acer Electronic Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography system interconnection " revealing that the PLA's Joint Operations Command System appears to be very powerful and impressive, but in fact it is all over-packaged. For example, the "509+ platform" on which the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the leadership of the provincial military districts is based on World War II-era technology; secondly, "relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite telephones to establish mobile communications in motion" is the technical support on which the command communication link from the PLA's provincial - city - county and military command center. Among them, "communication in motion" refers to the ability to communicate in a moving military vehicle; In addition, the "Acer E-Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography System" on which the communication link between the army and local command relies is also very fragile, and will soon be paralyzed after the war. The "quick conference system" used for the Guangdong military district meeting this time is in the civilian standard and of very low-quality, reflecting the outdated standard of the PLA's communication system and operational command system.The intelligence described in detail the PLA's operational command system, communications system configuration, and the significantly different generation from the U.S. operational command system, which would give the free world the confidence to defeat the CCP.

## 第三部分

广东省任务来自东部和南部战区、国防动员征兵办以及国家国动委。经研判，广东省的任务主要有五部分：力保台海决战、支持远弋基本、参加南海互通、协助港澳维稳、维护后方稳固。广东省省长王伟中负责的广东省国防动员中心汇报动员指导、创建三区动员部署、五类任务区分的情况（五类任务：地面征召、海上支持动员、新域新制、装备物资动员、地面防卫力量动员），并围绕三个需重点关注的方面进行研讨：兵源征召、海上支援动员、新域新质力量动员。除三个重点研讨的方面外，广东省军区政委黄善春还对海外动员提出补充意见。

Part 3，Guangdong Province mission from the Eastern and Southern Theater Command, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Mobilization Committee. After the study and assessment, the tasks of Guangdong Province mainly have five parts: to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory),  be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front. Wang Weizhong, Guangdong Provincial Governor, in charge of reporting the Guangdong Provincial Defense Mobilization Center’s mobilization instruction, creating a three-zone deployment of mobilization, distributing five tasks (Recruitment, Maritime support mobilization, Resource mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, Mobilization of equipment and materials, and Mobilization of ground defense forces), and conduct discussions around three key areas: the recruitment of troops, the mobilization of maritime support, and the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities. In addition to the three key areas of discussion, Huang Shanchun, political commissar of the Guangdong Military Region, also made supplementary comments on overseas mobilization.


1、广东省任务来自东部和南部战区、国防动员征兵办以及国家国动委：
（1）“一是东部和南部战区向我省下达的动员任务共20类，239项，主要是各类分队1,358支，共140,000人，各型船舶953艘，各种无人装备1653台次/套。机场、码头20个，修、造船厂6家，应急转送中心14个，以及粮库，医院，血站，油库，加油站等资源”，这是解放军东部战区和南部战区向广东省下达命令，在规定的期限内要求广东省必须动员14万非现役人员，征召或生产953艘民船，以及征召或生产1653台次/套无人装备（包括无人机和无人舰艇）。此外还征召机场、码头20个，修、造船厂6家，这些被征召的民企都会派军代表进驻。

1、The tasks of Guangdong Province come from the Eastern and Southern Theater Commands, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Movement Commission:

"First, the eastern and southern theaters have assigned a total of 20 categories and 239 mobilization tasks to the province, mainly 1,358 sub-units of various types with a total of 140,000 troops, 953 ships of various types, and 1,653 units/sets of various unmanned equipment. 20 airports and docks, 6 repair and shipbuilding yards, 14 emergency transfer centers, and other resources such as grain depots, hospitals, blood stations, oil depots, gas stations, etc." This is an order from the PLA Eastern and Southern War Zones to Guangdong Province, which is required to mobilize 140,000 non-active duty persons, to recruit or produce 953 civilian ships, and recruit or produce 1,653 units/set of unmanned equipment within a specified time limit ( including drones and unmanned ships). In addition, 20 airports and wharfs, and 6 repair and shipyards have been recruited. These recruited private enterprises will send military representatives to station there.

“二是国防动员征兵办会于我省征集新兵役人员，退役军人，特专人才共计15500人”，征召“特专人才共计15500人”是指从华为等大的科技企业征召懂编程、电子或高新技术的技术工程师，以及机工、钳工等专业技师。

Second, The Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office will recruit new conscrips, retired military personnel, special professionals in total 15,500 people", the recruitment of refers to the "special professionals people" is to recruit from large technology companies, such as Huawei that are capable of programming, electronics or high-tech engineers, as well as machinists, pliers and other professional technicians.

（3）“三是国家国动委明确，由我省协调落实的区域内国家潜力战略资源，主要包括万吨级火车/船及船舶64艘，飞机38架，火车车厢588节以及机场、房屋等民事设施19个”。

(3) "Thirdly, the National Mobilization Committee clearly indicates that the potential strategic resources of the country in the region that will be coordinated and implemented in our province mainly include 64 10,000-ton trains/ships and ships, 38 aircraft, 588 train cars and 19 civil facilities such as airports and houses."

2、经研判，广东省的任务主要有五部分：经研判，广东省的任务主要有五部分：力保台海决战、支持远弋基本、参加南海互通、协助港澳维稳、维护后方稳固。

2、After the assessment, the task of Guangdong Province mainly has five parts:  to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory),  be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front.

（1）支持远弋基本任务中，“支持远弋基本，组织远洋新式力量，对第一岛链外侦察、搜潜、搜救，保障火箭军部队前推部署”中提到的“第一岛链外”的国家包括日本、菲律宾等国，“保障火箭军部队前推部署”意味着还上要有充足的人员来填补解放军火箭军部队在向第一岛链外推进时所产生的战斗人员的减员。

（1）Be able to conduct long-range strike ( Extra long distance strike capability, longer than 300 kilometers ), form the new ocean-going forces, to reconnaissance, submarine search, search and rescue outside the first island chain. The countries mentioned in the "guaranteeing the forward deployment of Rocket Forces" include Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. "Ensuring the advanced deployment of the Rocket Force" means that there must be sufficient personnel at sea to fill the attrition of fighters generated when the PLA Rocket Force pushes beyond the first island chain.

（2）协助港澳维稳任务中，“组织口岸管控，维护港澳民生保障，防敌以港乱中。”意味着香港和澳门在战时状态下交由解放军广东省军区管理。

(2) Assist in the task of maintaining stability in Hong Kong and Macau, "organize border control, maintain the security of the livelihood of Hong Kong and Macau, and prevent the enemy from using Hong Kong to disrupt China." means that Hong Kong and Macao will under the PLA Guangdong Military Region management in a wartime state.

（3）维护后方稳固任务中，“协助守好61个重要军事目标和276个重要民事目标”就是要防止被中共定义的“特务”渗透和破坏。

(3) Among the tasks of maintaining the stability of the home front, "assisting in guarding 61 important military targets and 276 important civilian targets" is to prevent infiltration and sabotage by "secret agents" as defined by the Chinese Communist Party.

3、在兵源征召方面，珠三角有中国各行各业的顶尖人才，解放军要把他们都动员起来。鉴于目前中共完成任务的时间紧迫，中国政府“借助大数据技术”可以识别公民的个人信息，通过分析个人资产、专业技能资质、个人履历、出行轨迹等多方面信息，精准定位解放军想要征召的人员。具体落实在执行部门的会议上，所讨论的内容都是如何防范与惩治，以及不择手段去实现目标——这才是真正的恐怖。对征召人员进行反复上门劝导，威逼利诱。对于不配合征召的人，会加大惩处力度。中国也制定了相关措施来惩治不愿服从征召的公民。李希对于征兵工作中“既有人踊跃报名参战，也有人畏战、怯战、避战”的情况提出“宣传范围要广”、“帮扶力度要大”的讲话之后，有下属提出“除正面激励以外，还要依法加大惩处力度”，即对不配合征召的个体要依法加大惩处力度。路德社就是告诉大家注意防范，如果不幸被征召，在将来的战争中就会成为炮灰。我们不要为权贵特权国家资本的中国而战，这个虚假的体系本身没有能力去打仗，就是绑架中国各行各业的人。这也是中国从严、从紧严控公民出国的原因，就是为了防止高技术人才的流失。

3、Regarding recruitment, the Pearl River Delta has some of China's top talents from all fields, and the PLA needs to mobilize them all. Due to the current time limitations of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government has been able to identify citizens' personal information "through their Big Data technology" and to pinpoint who the PLA wants to recruit by analyzing personal assets, professional skills and qualifications, personal history, and travel patterns. In the meetings of the executive branch, the discussions are all about how to prevent and punish, and how to do whatever it takes to achieve the goal - which is the truly terrorist. The recruiters can be persuaded by repeated visits and intimidation. For those who do not cooperate with the recruitment, the punishment must be increased. China has also established measures to punish citizens who do not want to obey the recruitment process. Li Xi's suggestion for the conscription work is "there are some people who are enthusiastically enrolled in the war, but there are also people who are afraid of war, timid to fight, and avoid war" so we need more extensive propaganda, and much more powerful support. In addition, a follower added "in addition to positive motivation, but also to intensify the punishment according to the law", that is, the individual who does not cooperate with the recruitment should meet with greater punishment according to the law. Lude Media keeps telling people to take precautions, and if it is unfortunate to be recruited, it will certainly become a casualty of war. China is not worthy of having its people fight for it. The reason for China's strictly and tightly controlled citizens leaving the country is to prevent the wastage of highly skilled individuals.

4、在海上支援动员上，主要是应对各类船舶项目任务重，战时随船人员质优率，装备设备适配率还有些矛盾问题。

4、 In maritime support and mobilization, it is mainly to deal with the heavy tasks of various ship projects, the high quality rate of crew members during wartime, and the adaptation rate of equipment. There are still some contradictions.

（1）船舶加改装问题方面，“战区下达的任务是，45天内完成365艘滚装船等各类船舶的加改装，此外辖域内国家层面占用资源64艘船，还有8艘，明确由我省负责。全省具备能力的船舶修造企业90家，能够一次性总共组织113艘船加改装，这月内可完成280艘”，目前解放军拟采取的三种办法“一是，聚优集中，利用全省大型修造船厂，组织千吨级以上输送船舶，分类集中实施。二是，多点分布，沿海各市选取23处码头，多点快速组织技渔船加改装。三是，跨区资源，从广州，江门，湛江抽组船舶修造力量，加强至粤东地区。相关工作建议由我们牵头，汇同省农业农村经济厅组织指导各市，推进落实。”这一段情报有巨大的军事价值，解放军自己承认的民用码头和企业就是军事目标了，美军可以定点清除。加改装的船只中有64艘是万吨级以上的，其他都是万吨级以下的；23个码头负责改渔船，解放军对渔船都要进行武器化改装，也意味着粤东地区会有军事改装船。解放军认为只要是民用设施美国就不会将其作为军事目标来重点关注，所以只需“加强修造船厂的防护”即可。但现在情报已经解密、证据确凿，美军肯定会对会议中涉及的武器化改装的民用设施进行打击，所以路德社呼吁从事改装船的工人不要去从事民船武器化改装的工作，否则会有丧失生命的的风险，奉劝大家离战争远一点。

(1) Regarding the issue of ship weaponization, “The task assigned by the Theater Command is to complete the weaponization of 365 ro-ro ships and other types of ships within 45 days. In addition, there are 64 ships occupied at the national level within the jurisdiction, and 8 ships are clearly under the responsibility of our province. There are 90 capable ship repair and construction enterprises in the province, which can organize a total of 113 ships to be weaponized at one time, and 280 ships can be completed within this month.” At present, the PLA intends to take three approaches "First, the concentration of excellence, utilization of the province's large ship repair and shipbuilding plants to organize more than 1,000-ton transport vessels, adoption of classification and centralized implementation. Second, multi-point distribution, selected 23 docks in coastal cities, multi-point rapid organization of technical fishing vessels weaponization.
Third, cross-regional resource integration, selected ship repair work forces from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang to strengthen the eastern part of Guangdong. The relevant work is recommended to be led by us, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Economy organization will guide the cities to push  forward the implementation." 
This piece of intelligence has tremendous military value; the PLA has testified to confirm that civilian docks and private enterprises have been used for military purposes and are no longer civilian, which would qualify them as military targets and allow the U.S. military to take targeted killings. The addition of weaponized vessels include 64 vessels of over 10,000 tons, the others are under 10,000 tons; 23 docks are responsible for weaponize fishing vessels, and the PLA is weaponizing all fishing vessels, which also means that there will be a large number of military weaponized vessels in the eastern part of Guangdong."strengthen the protection of ship repair facilities" because the PLA believes that as long as they are civilian facilities, the U.S. will not focus on them as military targets. But now that the intelligence has been declassified and the evidence is conclusive, the U.S. military will definitely hit the weaponized civilian facilities mentioned in the meeting, so Lude Media urges workers engaged in ship modifications not to work on weaponized civilian ship, or risk losing their lives, and advises everyone to stay away from war.
        

对万吨级滚装产船进行“加改装方案”，并“编组船上民兵，配备武器装备”，是要把万吨滚装船作为武器化用途，加改装的目的一是为了伪装，在远洋航行时躲避美军的识别；二是为了在船上加装导弹。由于此次会议是内部保密会议，所以参会人员才会口无遮拦、无所顾忌。

The "weaponized program" for the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel and the "formation of onboard militia and weapons" are intended to weaponize the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel for the purpose of disguising it and avoiding U.S. military identification during ocean voyages, and for the purpose of equipping it with missile systems. Since the meeting was an internal confidential meeting, that's why the participants were so open-mouthed and without worries.

（2）船队编组和人员装备的分配方面，解放军对武器化改装民船的人员配备的方案是“优化船上民兵，采取主要船员，加退伍军人，加装备混编模式。输送船舶主要编队防卫力量，加医疗人员，加通讯员。”，这是某种程度上的计划经济，是一种军管模式，和平时期在民船上工作的人员将会被解放军安排进去的退伍军人、和其他人员代替，但是民船老板却要承担这些解放军作战人员的工资。这里只是广东一个省的军区动员情况，中国其他省份的军区近期也都在召开类似的会议进行战争动员。会议提到“配强随船干部，按照保障项目和具体使用的不同，编成3个大队，45个中队，135支分队。准备随船干部231人，其中团职3名，营职45名，其他军队（改：军地）干部183名”，“对于国防动员中心提出231名随船干部需求，目前还缺现役干部68名，地方干部91名”，这是重要的军事情报，意味着解放军很难找到海上经验丰富的干部，231名随船干部目前还差68名。从这里可以推导出武器化民船的数量。

(2) Assignment of flotilla formation and people and equipment, the PLA's plan for the staffing of weaponized modified civilian ships is to "optimize the militia on board and adopt a mixed grouping model of main crew, plus veterans, and equipment.  The arrangement of veterans and other military personnel on the ship, replacing the real crew, not only affects the efficiency of work, but also the civilian ship owners have to bear the wages of these PLA soldiers, which is a great loss for the civilian ship owners.

Not only is the military region in Guangdong doing mobilization, but military regions in other Chinese provinces have also been holding similar meetings recently to mobilize for war. The meeting mentioned that "the military cadres accompanying the ships with guns are organized into 3 brigades, 45 squadrons and 135 detachments according to the different items of protection and specific use. Prepare to accompany the ship 231 cadres, including 3 regimental positions, 45 battalion positions, 183 other military and local cadres",  the National Defense Mobilization Center proposed it needs 231 cadres on board, but there is still a shortage of active duty 68 cadres, and 91 local cadres, which is an important military intelligence. This means that it is difficult for the PLA to find experienced cadres at sea, and the 231 cadres on board are currently 68 short. The number of weaponized civilian ships can be calculated from here. 

“从内地军分区调剂，特别是参加过海上重大维权行动，海军交流进来的团职干部，共有57名，可以依律补充”，这个情报验证了路德社之前的爆料。

"Transferred from the mainland military divisions, especially those who have participated in major maritime defense operations, the Navy exchange in the regiment cadres, there are 57, can be added in accordance with the rules", this information verifies the Lude Media previous expose.

5、关于新域新质动员方面，主要提到两千多件高新装备的配备、战时的网络和电力保障以及海外动员等几个问题。

5、Regarding the combat of novel-domains and capabilities mobilization, several issues such as the equipping of more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment, network and power security during the war, and overseas mobilization were mainly emphasized.

（1）两千多件高新装备的配备方面，会议提到“目前确保到位的无人机480架，无人艇70艘。需要抓紧时机转控”，“关于无人机，我省动员中心，深圳科卫泰、东莞XX（疑似洋华或阳华）月产能80架，建议紧急动员深圳智航，东莞众创，XXXXX， 广州红鹏等9家有这个生产能力的企业配合推进”，“我省无人艇动员中心 珠海鱼钩，江龙潜艇月产能可达90艘。以上两项任务均可（企业名称待验证）”，这些公司的暴露会让美国卫星重点关注，进而确认无人机、无人艇和相关设备的产能及产量。(建议推友反复听录音，排除噪音确认企业名称。)

(1) More than two thousand pieces of high-tech equipments provided, the meeting mentioned that " at present 480 unmanned aircraft and 70 unmanned boats in place. Need to accelerate the timing of the transfer control". "On the UAV, the province's mobilization center confirmed the Shenzhen Alltech, Dongguan XX (likely to be Yang Hua) monthly production capacity of 80, it is recommended that the urgent mobilization of Shenzhen Smart Drone UVA, Dongguan Zhongchuang Intelligent Equipment and Guangzhou Hopong Helicopter Remote and other nine enterprises with this production capacity to work together to complete". "The province's unmanned boat mobilization center Zhuhai Yunzhou, and Jianglong Shipbuilding monthly production capacity can be 90. Both of these tasks can be completed (enterprise name to be verified)", the exposure of these companies will allow the U.S. to pay more attention on  the production capacity of drones, unmanned boats and related equipment. 

（2）战时的网络和电力保障方面，广东省通过“动员集安信、华为等重点高新企业”，以及“加强对金融、能源、电力、交通行业，信息系统的监控预警安全防护”，确保关键领域安全网格防线不失守。广东省军区“编建了四支卫星侦察分队，共有低轨卫星16颗"，并且认为他们现有的0.5至10米的分辨率就是“超高光学分辨率成像能力”，这其实连美国商用卫星0.1米的分辨率都达不到。“目前广东省卫星共有四个地面接收站，其中珠海一个，黑龙江漠河，新疆乌苏，山东高密各一个”，请Be water的力量去Google Earth搜获，并请居住在附近的Be wate进行布点。

(2) Wartime network and power security, Guangdong Province, through the "mobilization of key high-tech enterprises, such as JiAnxin, Huawei", as well as "strengthen surveillance and early warning security protection of information systems in the financial, energy, power and transportation industries," to ensure that the security grid defense of key areas will not be lost.

（3）海外动员方面，广东省军区政委黄善春提到：“采取以民掩军，以民援军的方式，以险结合，动员购置高端芯片，精密机械，特种材料等国内紧缺物资。以及石油，粮食，矿产等大宗战略储备物资，破解战时美西方联盟对我战略物资围追堵截的困局，大力动员海外华人华侨和团体，积极参与支援保障我军事行动，加大特殊专业人才引进力度，力求全球一切资源可为我所用，确保以外援内的有效果，有效益，有效率。”。意味着中共高层早已知晓美国对中国的制裁和封锁即将到来，并且通过一带一路、以及海外军民融合项目进行物资采购。路德社早就告诉大家中美产业链的彻底脱钩是无法阻挡的，中共就发动郭文贵这样的海外特务来渗透美国政界，以图影响美国与中国产业链脱钩的决定。

(3) For overseas mobilization, Huang Shanchun, Political Commissar of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, mentioned: "By using the methods of covering the army with the people and supporting the army with the people, combining risks and mobilizing the purchase of high-end chips, precision machinery, special materials and other materials that are in short supply in China, as well as petroleum , grain, minerals and other large-scale strategic reserve materials,to crack the dilemma of the U.S. and Western alliances on my strategic materials siege during wartime, vigorously mobilize overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese groups, actively participate in supporting and safeguarding my military operations, increase the introduction of special professionals, aim to all resources worldwide can be used for me, to ensure that foreign aid within the effective, efficient and effective." It means that the top CCP has long been aware of the imminent sanctions and blockade of the United States against China, and has been purchasing materials through the Belt and Road Initiative and overseas military-civilian integration projects. The Lude Media has long told everyone that the complete decoupling of the Sino-US industrial chain is unstoppable. The CCP has launched overseas spies like Guo Wengui to infiltrate the US political circles in an attempt to influence the decision to decouple the US from the Chinese industrial chain.

6、对于会议第三部分的总结，指挥员提到“第一，要强化大局意识，聚力复归一统，蕴含战略决胜，是统一之战，复兴之战，只能成功不能失败，我们要坚决贯彻党中央，中央军委决策意图，强化政治意识，全体意识，号令意识，坚决做到，全部精力，向打仗聚焦，一切工作为打仗服务，所有资源向打仗倾斜，为实现祖国完全统一，民族伟大复兴贡献广东力量。”

For the summary of the third part of the meeting, the commander mentioned that "first, strengthening the awareness of the overall situation, focusing on reunification, containing a strategic victory, is the battle of unification, the battle of rejuvenation, can only succeed can not fail, Implement the decision-making intention of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, strengthen political awareness, overall awareness, order awareness, resolutely implement, all energy, focus on the war, all work serves the war, all resources are inclined to war, in order to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland and the greatness of the nation Rejuvenation contributes to Guangdong's strength."

## 第四部分

广东省军区司令员周合组织研究筹划地面防备作战任务，并强调“战略决胜：是统一之战，复兴之战，只能成功不能失败。”

The fourth part: Zhou He, the commander of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, studied and planned ground defense combat missions, and emphasized that "strategic decisive victory: it is a battle of unification, a battle of revival, and it can only succeed but not fail."

1、粤东四市的地面防卫作战归东部战区指挥，由武警广东总队牵头组建7000人参加。从这可以看到解放军号称有几百万兵力，其实都是分散的，在地方的兵力很薄弱，即便路德社爆料中共在地方的军力部署，由于动员能力有限，短期内不会增加粤东四市的兵力部署。

1、The ground defense operations of the four cities in eastern Guangdong are under the command of the Eastern Theater Command, and 7,000 people are led by the Guangdong Armed Police Corps to participate. From this, it can be seen that the PLA claims to have several million troops, but in fact they are scattered and the local troops are very weak. Even Lude Media has already exposed the news that the CCP's local military deployment, due to its limited mobilization ability, will not deploy more troops in the four cities of eaeastern Guangdong in the short term. 

2、会议提到“重要防卫目标包括，战区联合作战指挥中心，海上作战分中心等重要军事目标，以及大亚湾核电站，华南电网等重要民事目标”，路德社分析指出广东省军区列出的防卫目标在现代战争中几乎是在战前就会被摧毁的。这次暴露了解放军军事与防卫部署的实际能力，其能力的低下程度令人震惊。

2、The meeting mentioned that "important defense targets include important military targets such as theater joint operations command center and maritime operations sub-center, as well as important civilian targets such as Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and South China Power Grid." Targets in modern warfare are destroyed almost before the battle. This time, the actual capabilities of the PLA's military and defense deployments have been exposed, and the level of its capabilities is shockingly low.

3、会议提到“关于其他配属力量使用有两个方案。第一，集中使用 将武警广州总队机动支队武警机动六支队，现一个机动大队和海防311旅部分力量，共约6000人编为三个机动群，配置在深圳，广州，湛江地区。担负珠三角和粤西地区机动支持和反恐维稳任务。第二，分散使用 将武警机动六支队的四个大队约1600人，分别配属给汕尾，惠州，阳江，河源”，即广东、深圳和湛江只有6000人的卫戍部队（轻兵），要么全部配备在珠三角，要么就按照“粤东四市1600人+佛山、湛江约500人+由指挥部指挥的机动作战群4000人分四个群”分散使用。解放军把6000人称作“一定规模兵力”，这就是虚张声势。

3、The meeting mentioned that "there are two options for the use of other assigned forces. First, the centralized use of the Armed Police Guangzhou General Force Mobile Detachment Armed Police Mobile Six Detachment, currently a mobile brigade and part of the 311 brigade of coastal defense forces, a total of about 6,000 people into three mobile groups, allocation in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang area. The task of mobile back-up and anti-terrorism stability maintenance in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong. Second, the use of diversion of the four brigades of the six detachments of the armed police mobile about 1,600 people, respectively, assigned to Shanwei, Huizhou, Yangjiang, Heyuan, "that is, Guangdong, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang only 6,000 people garrison (light troops), either all equipped in the Pearl River Delta, otherwise, it would be used in accordance with the "four cities in eastern Guangdong, 1,600 people, Foshan, Zhanjiang, about 500 people by the command of the mobile combat group of 4,000 people in four groups" divided. The PLA calls 6,000 people "a sizable force", which is a bluff.

4、会议提到“208 海防311旅两个海防群，约500人携带轻武器，分别配属给佛山，湛江这六个单位重要军事目标，防卫任务较重，自身防卫力量较弱，应予加强”，这意味着负责佛山、湛江维稳工作的是海防311旅两个海防营，由配备轻武器的500名士兵组成，对于人口超越千万级的两个地区只部署区区500人的防卫力量显得微不足道。这500名士兵配备的轻武器不是枪械，而是棍子、钢叉等冷兵器。这是中共对中国人的心理战，中共想用极其稀少的兵力伪装出强大的军团，以此恐吓中国人，让中国人畏惧并放弃反抗。当中国人通过路德社得知真相后，就会有反抗中共政权的信心。

4、The meeting mentioned that "the 208 Coastal defense 311 Brigade has two coastal defense groups, with about 500 people carrying light weapons, which are assigned to the six important military targets of Foshan and Zhanjiang. The defense tasks are heavy and their own defense forces are weak, and should be strengthened." , which means that the two coastal defense battalions of the 311 Brigade of Haiphong are responsible for the stability maintenance work in Foshan and Zhanjiang. They are composed of 500 soldiers equipped with light weapons. The defense force of only 500 people deployed in the two areas with populations exceeding 10 million is insignificant. The light weapons these 500 soldiers are equipped with are not firearms, but cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks. This is the CCP's psychological warfare against the Chinese. The CCP wants to use extremely scarce troops to disguise a powerful army, in order to intimidate the Chinese, make the Chinese fear and give up resistance. When the Chinese learn the truth through Lude Media, they will have the confidence to resist the CCP regime.

总结：

由于路德社的情报力量渗透进中共政权的最高层，这使得中共高层的秘密战略随时都会曝光，请中共再不要再掩耳盗铃，你们所有的“顶级保密”在更高的科技维度面前，都是全面敞开的，就像今天播放的录音一样，接下来全世界都会知道你们的详细计划。路德社节目不断可以被验证的原因就是路德社爆料的每句话基本都是中共高层领导亲口说的。

Since Lude Media's intelligence forces have penetrated the highest levels of the Chinese Communist regime, the secret strategies of the Communist Party will be exposed at any time. The world will know the details of their schemes.

此次会议录音极具情报价值，主要表现在几个方面：第一、暴露了解放军平战转换和战备动员的机密情况；第二、战备动员会议涉及到的数据、位置以及布防信息均已暴露。

The high value of the recording of this meeting is that, first, it exposes the secret situation of the PLA's transition from peacetime to wartime and strategic mobilization; second, the strategic mobilization meeting has exposed classified data, location, and deployment.

中共全力诱骗中国人主动去前线做炮灰，他们自己却躲在安全的“作战指挥中心”，中共的战争是建立在欺骗中国人参军，牺牲生命的基础之上的；中共在战时为了防止供应链和原材料的断裂，可以直接抢夺中国人的生产生活物资，作为战备资源；中共在战时管控社会流动的手段就是自2020年以来所采取的“强制清零”封控手段，以达到对中国人的网格化管控；即便到了战时中共也不敢向其维稳部队发枪，只许其使用棍棒、钢叉等冷兵器，中共战时维稳的做法就是用障眼法欺骗中国人，让中国人以为有有很多军队在预防大规模社会性骚乱，但其实只有区区几千人，对于广东这个超过1亿人口的大省来讲是微不足道的。中共做的每件事，都在欺骗中国人，中国人一旦在真相中觉醒，就不会被中共的障眼法欺骗，中共的统治就会土崩瓦解。

The Chinese Communist Party is doing its best to deceive Chinese people to voluntarily go to the front line and take bullets for the Party and die for their country, while they hide themselves in the safety net called " combat command center".
Everything the CCP did was to deceive the Chinese people and sacrifice the lives of Chinese to achieve their welfare.
The Chinese Communist Party can directly grab the Chinese people's production and living materials as war resources in order to prevent the cut-off of supply chains and raw materials in wartime.
The CCP's means of controlling social movement during wartime is the " compulsory zero-tolerance" approach adopted since 2020, in order to achieve grid-based control of the Chinese people.
Even in wartime, the CCP does not dare to arm its stabilization forces with guns, and only allows them to use cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks.
The CCP's wartime stability maintenance practice is to deceive the Chinese by using a deception to make Chinese people think that there are many troops to prevent large-scale social disorders, but in fact there are only a limited number of thousands of people, which is a tiny amount for Guangdong, a province with a population of over 100 million.
The Chinese people have been deceived and enslaved for too long . Wake up, Chinese people, our awakening will be the time that the Chinese Communist Party's regime falls apart.

根据路德社的判断：（1）请普通中国人远离战争，不要成为中共的牺牲品；（2）会议暴露了解放军作战水平的低劣，解放军在未来战争中必输；（3）中共政权已经到了末日，暴露出中共的动员能力已经弱化到一定程度了，连几百人的战争动员都很难做到了，并且不敢给维稳军队配备枪支；（4）中共非常怕“以港乱中”，即香港、澳门的局势失控导致不稳定因素影响广东省，同时中共很怕湛江失控，因为湛江离越南比较近，路德社号召中国无处不在的反抗力量要有所行动。

According to Lude Media 's judgment: (1) ordinary Chinese are please to stay away from the war and not to become the victims of the CCP; (2) the meeting exposed the inferiority of the PLA's combat skills and that the PLA is definitely going to lose in future wars; (3) the CCP's regime is at the terminal stage, revealing that the CCP's mobilization ability has been weakened to a certain extent and it is extremely difficult to mobilize even a few hundred people for war, and it does not dare to arm the stabilization army with guns; (4) the CCP is terribly frightened that the situation in Hong Kong and Macau will affect Guangdong Province if it gets out of hand. (4) The CCP is very scared of "chaos in China with Hong Kong", in other words, if the situation in Hong Kong and Macau goes out of control, it will lead to instability affecting Guangdong Province, and the CCP is also very scared that Zhanjiang will run out of control, because Zhanjiang is closer to Vietnam, and Lude Media is  calling for immediate action by China's omnipresent fighting forces.
