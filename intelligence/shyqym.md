# 上海疫情的背后阴谋

1、中共当局所谓的对上海的解封，就是在用一松一紧的方式做对民意进行试探，以便发现不稳定因素，如果有失控的情况就全面封城，如果形式可控就局部封城。上海的“解封”可以类比集中营的放风，让民意短暂可控的释放，同时逐一筛查“可疑份子”。

1、The real purpose of the Chineses Communist regime to end the lockdown of Shanghai is to measure their people’s tolerance level by using this loosening and tightening approach (lockdown  and end of lockdown the city alternated on demand), it also can help the CCP to improve and perfect their controlling System with this approach. If, after the ending of the lockdown, the social order and other aspects get out of control, the city will be fully re-lockdown immediately. If everything was under control, they would lockdown the city partially (only lockdown some areas and communities.) The "unlockdown" of Shanghai can be described as the release of prisoners from the concentration camps. By temporarily ending the lockdown, not only the public can be released in a short time and under a controllable manner, but at the same time the “suspicious” deemed by CCP can be filtered one by one.

此外，上海“解封”也是中宣部换完领导以后的新舆论策略，目的是把李克强推向前台，将社会不满的焦点从习近平转移到李克强，这种欺骗策略意味着离中共正式行动的日子已经很近了——中共对台湾是志在必得，如可行尽量采取包围而不进攻的策略。

Additionally,  the Shanghai “unlockdown” is also a new Public Opinion strategy after the replacement of the leadership of the National Central Propaganda Department. Their intent to place Li Keqiang in the spotlight and divert the focus of public discontent and dissatisfaction from Xi Jinping to Li Keqiang, which is a distraction strategy to mislead and lie to the public, it also means that the CCP starts their official action is very imminent - the CCP is determined to seize Taiwan, and it is planned to use the tactic of encirclement but not attack, cutting off foreign aid and trapping Taiwan until it is submitted to the CCP. 

台湾只是中共战略决胜中的一个步骤，最终目标是迫使美国签订城下之盟（中共部署在漠河的东风-41只需18分钟就可以从北极打到美国）。

Taiwan is only a step in the CCP's Strategic Decisive Victory. Their ultimate ambition is to force the U.S. to sign a dishonorable peace as the defeated. The CCP has absolute self-confidence because "their DF-41 ICBM deployed in Mohe (It is the city in the northernmost place in China, the most north village in Mohe located at (53°30′00″N 123°03′00″E) can be launched from Mohe and strike directly at the U.S. mainland via the Arctic within just 18 minutes.
 
因为中共多年来一直在研究对美国作战的战术，他们自知无法正面与美军抗衡，鉴于古巴导弹危机的经验，逼美国谈和是有可能成功的。

Since the CCP has been studying and analyzing  the war tactic against the U.S. for many years, they understand they must avoid fighting with the U.S. military directly, so they will use the experience of the "Cuban Missile Crisis" to force the U.S. to negotiate peace, which they think is the most possible way to succeed. 

只有真正理解中共的战略目的，才能找到正确的破解方法。

Only those who truly understand the strategic objectives of the CCP can figure out the right way to overcome them.

2、路德社将会持续揭露和解析中共的战略阴谋，只要中共不解体，路德社的工作就会继续。

2、Lude Media will persist in exposing and interpreting the strategic conspiracies of the CCP, and will persist in doing so as long as the CCP remains without disintegration. 

中共作为独裁体制，必然要对内保持伟大，有荣耀，永远正确的形象，因此对外就必须保持进攻姿态。

As a dictatorship, the CCP must always maintain an image of greatness, glory, and always right domestically, meanwhile it has to  maintain an on-the-offensive attitude abroad.

路德社基于长期对中共政治特点的研究，以及对习近平个人性格的了解，对与被中共威胁的各国决策者提出一些建议：

Based on its long-term analysis and research of the political characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party and its knowledge of Xi Jinping's unique personality, Lude Media would like to propose some recommendations for leaders of all countries threatened by the CCP.

战争的胜负不在于一城一池的得失，只要保持心理上的胜利，就都有翻盘的机会。

The success or failure of a war does not depend on the gains and losses of one city or one town, anyone who maintains a spiritual winning attitude has a chance to double their chances.

建议被中共威胁的周边各方转守为攻，这不一定是指军事攻击行动，主要是指采取主动应对的姿态，去破中共饱和攻击的招数。比如中共实现战略决胜的手段就是用民船、滚装船，甚至是民航飞机来进行饱和式攻击，来自广东省军区录音里面最核心的情报。为此，各国决策者应该及早预备，主动应对。

Lude Media is recommending that adjacent countries and regions threatened by the CCP should take a strategy of switching from defense to offense, which does not mean initiating military strike actions, but rather taking a proactive attitude to cope and crack the CCP's tactics of Saturation Attacks. For instance, the CCP's approach to achieving Strategic Decisive Victory is to use civilian ships, ro-ro ships, and even civilian aircraft to conduct Saturation Attacks. (This intelligence is from the recording of a meeting in the Guangdong Military District.) Accordingly, the leaders in each country should have early preparation and be proactive in coping with it.
