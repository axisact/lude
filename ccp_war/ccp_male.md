# 中共国称雄世界的如意算盘能够如愿吗

## 来自-阿童木

&emsp;&emsp;中共国挑战现有的国际规则已经是蓄谋已久了，从毛给新华社的题字“新华社要把地球管理起来”就可以看出端倪，毛在位时与苏联之间的分歧和冲突，无非是要做社会主义阵营的老大，不过毛治国的基础经济被他玩残了，他又同时得罪了世界两强美帝和苏修（这两个都是他对美国与苏联的说法），在进入1970年代时，毛在国际上已是穷途末路，他不得不联合美帝，弄出三个世界的理论，以对抗苏修和他的阵营。

&emsp;&emsp;The Chinese Communist Party's regime has long been preparing to challenge existing international orders. It can be traced from Mao Zedong's inscription to the Xinhua News Agency--"The Xinhua News Agency must dominate the world". The major divisions and collision with the Soviet Union during Mao's era of dominance was nothing more than the struggle to be the leader of the Communist camp. But the economic foundation of Mao's dominance was completely ruined by himself, other than that, Mao simultaneously offended the two most powerful countries in the world, the "U.S. Imperialism" and "Soviet Union Revisionism" (both of which were his words for the U.S. and Soviet Union). Upon entering the 1970s, the situation forced him to ally with the U.S. and fight against the Soviet with his "Three Worlds Theory".

&emsp;&emsp;随着毛的离世，毛在国际上的四面出击打法被邓的韬光养晦策略所取代，邓很聪明，他明白积贫羸弱的家底是打不过殷实富裕的大户之家，所以他给中共国定下了调子，一心一意谋发展，基本路线100年不动摇，但是发展的目标是不变的，就是“要把地球管理起来”。

&emsp;&emsp;After Mao's death, Mao's strategy of attacking out of all directions were replaced by Deng Xiaoping's strategy of hiding the capabilities and biding the perfect time. Deng was very intelligent and smart, he wisely figured out that a poor and fragile country was incapable of beating a rich and wealthy country. Therefore, he made a unique policy for the development of the Communist Party of China. To be ready to "dominate the world", we must wholeheartedly focus on development and building up strength, as well as sticking  to the fundamental policy without shaking for 100 years.

&emsp;&emsp;经过江时期的闷声发大财，胡时期的和平崛起，中共国在美国的体系里，中国人民可以发挥聪明才智，创造和积累了大量的财富，中共国成为了世界第二大的经济体。

&emsp;&emsp;After a the strategy of refraining from showing the profits CCP has made under Jiang Zemin’s time, and rising peacefully under Hu Jintao’s time, the Chinese Communist Party has made a huge fortune with chinese people's talents and wisdom under U.S. system since then has risen and rised to the second largest economy in the world. 

&emsp;&emsp;这个时候，习总加速师上位了，中共国在习的带领下，终于不再隐藏了，到了该“把地球管理起来”的时候了。

&emsp;&emsp;As Xi Jinping has taken over the top chair of China (We call him the Master Accelerator, who has been speeding up China's backward progress.) the Chinese Communist Party believed that the time of "dominate the world" has come, and that they are finally no longer concealing their ambitions.

&emsp;&emsp;结合《路德节目》的相关披露，习总加速师实现“把地球管理起来”的第一步是联合俄罗斯，搞定欧洲大陆；第二步是先掌控印太地区的主导权，将美国排挤出印太地区；第三步是与俄罗斯一起，共同拿下美国；第四步是非洲拉美；第五步就是独霸天下，塑造人类命运共同体。

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the relevant disclosures of the Lude Media, it can be deduced that Xi accelerates the implementation of the steps to “dominate the world”. The first step is to be joined with Russia to take over Europe Continental; the second step is dominating the Indo-Pacific region and to expel the United States from it; the third step is to work with Russia to conquer and defeat United States; the fourth step is to overall domination of  Africa and Latin America; and the last step is to unify the world by force and reshape a community of human destiny.

&emsp;&emsp;中共国掌控印太地区的第一个障碍就是台湾和日本，台日后面又有美国背书，所以习总加速师的谋士们为他制定了因地制宜的可操作方案。

&emsp;&emsp;The prior obstacles for the Communist Party of China to dominate the Indo-Pacific region are Taiwan and Japan. Since Taiwan and Japan are well backed by the United States, Accelerator Xi's advisors have drawn up an operational measure according to local conditions. 

&emsp;&emsp;古代中国是人类兵法的发源地，中国兵法著作层出不穷，而且是博大精深。

&emsp;&emsp;Ancient China has given birth to numerous masterpieces about the art of war.

&emsp;&emsp;《孙子兵法•谋攻篇》是讲解军事进攻的篇章，其中的“上兵伐谋，其次伐交，其次伐兵，其下攻城；攻城之法为不得已”分别是进攻策略中的上策、中策和下策，伐兵是下策，而伐城则是下下策了。

&emsp;&emsp;The chapter of Attack by Stratagem in "The Art of War" is about military offense, in which “the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.” That introduces the superior, secondary and inferior strategies in the attacking strategy. It can be simply interpreted that attacking the army is the second-best policy, and besieging the city is the worst.

&emsp;&emsp;只有上兵伐谋的“不战而屈人之兵”才是上上策。习总加速师对台湾实行“强统”，而不是“武统”，这符合“不战而屈人之兵”的上上策。

&emsp;&emsp;So, the skillful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; however accelerater Xi's "coercive domination" of Taiwan, rather than "unification by force", matches the best policy of "subduing the enemy’s troop without any fight”

&emsp;&emsp;今天听了路德节目里讲了中共国要和日本发生武力冲突，这就走上了伐兵与伐城的下策之路了。

&emsp;&emsp;Today's Lude Media talked about the Chinese communist regime being in armed military conflict with Japan, which goes down the route of “attacking the enemies and besieging cities.”

&emsp;&emsp;以前网上专家有言：“中日必有一战”，看来这些说法不是空穴来风。为了把美国排挤出印太地区，中共国不惜与日本兵戎相见而大动干戈，这也是中共蓄谋已久的。

&emsp;&emsp;There was some people in the internet predicted that " the war between China and Japan is inevitable", and it seems that this kind of sayings are not empty words. In order to drive the U.S. Out of the Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese Communist Party has been scheming for a long time that the Chinese  will do everything to start a war against Japan without hesitation.

&emsp;&emsp;据《路德节目》的情报来源，中共国将在钓鱼岛与日本擦枪走火，然后嫁祸于日本军队率先向中国军人开火，最终中共将借口日本“军国主义”死灰复燃，并且要重新瓜分亚洲，称霸亚洲，奴役亚洲，第二次世界大战的人类灾难在日本“军国主义”的复活中卷土重来。

&emsp;&emsp;According to the intelligence source of "Lude Media", the Chinese Communist Party is trying to “shot accidentally while polish a gun” with Japan in the Diaoyu Islands, and then blame the Japanese army took the first shot towards Chinese soldiers, and eventually the Chinese Communist Party will use the resurgence of Japanese "militarism" as a cause: to Re-division of Asia, aiming of dominating and enslaving Asia, and the human disaster of the Second World War will return in the resurgence of Japanese "militarism".

&emsp;&emsp;中共国将号召二战中所有受到日本侵略、占领和伤害的亚洲国家和地区，团结在中共国领导的亚洲抗日统一战线下，完成对日本的抗击，以实现中共未来“管理地球”战略的第一步，即在印太地区的控制主导权。

&emsp;&emsp;The Communist Party of China will mobilize all Asian countries and regions that were invaded, occupied and attacked by Japan in World War II to rally under the Communist Party of China-led Asian Anti-Japanese War Front and carry out strikes against Japan in order to achieve the first step of the Communist Party of China's ambitious to "managing the world", i.e., taking over the control of the Indo-Pacific region.

&emsp;&emsp;中共国的这一招式极为高明和险恶，可以说中共吃透了中国传统兵法与谋略的精髓，并且又完全融合了现代的营销推广、心理学和预见性认知的精华，这些多重复合型招数如一连串组合拳一样，向日本打出致命一击。

&emsp;&emsp;This ploy of the Chinese Communist Party is extremely well sophisticated and sinister. It can be said that the Chinese Communist Party has learned the essence of traditional Chinese military tactics and strategies, and has perfectly blended the essence of modern marketing promotion, psychology and foresight cognition, and these multiple complex ploys are like a series of combinations to hit Japan with a devastating blow.

&emsp;&emsp;借用“军国主义”死灰复燃和卷土重来，唤起亚洲多数国家对二战中日本犯下罪行的仇恨，达到分化多数亚洲国家，孤立日本的目的，把道义上的制高点转化为战略上的制高点，预让美国失去支持和帮助日本的合理性。

&emsp;&emsp;By taking advantage of the resurgence of "militarism" to trigger the hatreds of the majority of Asian countries for the crimes committed by Japan in World War II, it can accomplish the division of the majority of Asian countries, and as well as the isolation of Japan, transforming the moral high ground into the military strategic high ground, while also preventing  the United States the justification of supporting and helping Japan.

&emsp;&emsp;古代中国用道义结合战略的制高点的例子最有名的是东汉末年曹操的“挟天子以令诸侯”，曹操以天子的名义号令天下，向反对他的人开战。中共非常了解这一点。

&emsp;&emsp;One of the most famous examples of ancient China using morality coupled with a strategic high ground to achieve victory is Cao Cao's "holding the emperor to order the princes" at the end of Eastern Han Dynasty. In the name of the emperor, Cao Cao commanded the country to go to war against those who opposed him.The Chinese Communist Party fully understands this.

&emsp;&emsp;中共除了用道义结合战略的制高点，还在其中复加上一层更为隐匿的损招，这就是古代中国兵法《三十六计》中的第十四计：借尸还魂。

&emsp;&emsp;Besides using morality to combine strategic high ground, the Chinese Communist Party has also used an even more disguised and detrimental tactic, which is the fourteenth tactic in the ancient Chinese art of war “The Thirty-Six Stratagems"------resurrecting a dead soul by borrowing a corpse.

&emsp;&emsp;借尸还魂：原意是说已经死亡的东西，又借助某种形式得以复活，用在军事上，是指利用、支配那些没有作为的势力来达到我方目的的策略。历史上常有这种情况，在改朝换代的时候，都喜欢推出亡国之君的后代，打着他们的旗号，来号召天下。用这种“借尸还魂”的方法，达到夺取天下的目的。

&emsp;&emsp;The original meaning of this ploy is that “Take an institution, a technology, a method, or even an ideology that has been forgotten or discarded and appropriate it for your own purpose. Revive something from the past by giving it a new purpose or bring to life old ideas, customs, or traditions and reinterpret them to fit your purposes.“ Used in terms of military, it is a strategy to utilize and dominate forces that are inactive to achieve their goals. Throughout history, there are very often cases where the descendants of the fallen kings are pushed out to mobilize the country under their names. By this means, the purpose of seizing the country is achieved.

&emsp;&emsp;借尸还魂有名的一个例子是《史记》对陈胜吴广大泽乡起义时，打着死去的公子扶苏和楚国大将项燕的名义，号令天下，共举大义，推翻暴秦。

&emsp;&emsp;A very famous example is about “resurrecting a dead soul by borrowing a corpse“ was recorded in "The Records of the Grand Historian", When Chen Sheng and Wu Guang revolted in Dazexiang, they rallied the country to raise a great uprising to overthrow the tyrant Qin in the name of the dead Prince, Fusu, and the Great General, Xiang Yan, of the Chu Dynasty.

&emsp;&emsp;中共国这次是借用“军国主义”僵尸，复活“军国主义”之魂，唤起所有人对二战日本军人暴行的仇恨与抗争，让饱受日本军国主义伤害的韩国，日本占领殖民的台湾没有了退路，只能与中共国联手灭掉日本。

&emsp;&emsp;This time, the Chinese Communist Party is invoking the evil power of "militarism" and resurrecting the soul of "militarism" to arouse public hatred and fight against the brutality of Japanese soldiers in World War II, so that Korea, which suffered from Japanese militarism, and Taiwan, which was occupation and colonization by Japan, have no way back but to team up with the Chinese Communist Party to destroy Japan.

&emsp;&emsp;至于东南亚，日本二战出兵同样用的是道义结合战略的制高点，那就是为东南亚人民驱逐西方殖民者，当时东南亚除了独立的泰国以外，其他国家都是英法及荷兰的殖民地，菲律宾则是美国的托管地。如果二战中日本没有战败，东南亚的一些国家是感激日本的，比如缅甸国父昂山将军……

&emsp;&emsp;In the case of Southeast Asia, Japan used the same moral and strategic high ground to send troops in World War II, which was to force out the Western colonizers for the people of Southeast Asia. At that time, except for independent Thailand, all other countries in Southeast were British-French and Dutch colonies, and the Philippines was a territory under the administration of the United States. If Japan had not been defeated in World War II, some countries in Southeast Asia would have been grateful to Japan, such as the father of the Burmese nation, General Aung San,  ......

&emsp;&emsp;还有台湾，本省人和原住民都有强烈的日本皇民情结，他们更多倾向于日本，魏德圣的电影《海角七号》就体现了这一点。很多外省人对待日本人态度在中共国“借尸还魂”的策略下，会与中共国的态度相近。

&emsp;&emsp;There is also Taiwan, where the aborigines have a strong Japanese imperial sentiment, and they lean more towards Japan, as reflected in Wei De Sheng's movie "Cape No. 7". Many Taiwanese would treat the Japanese with the same attitude as the Chinese Communist Party's regime.

&emsp;&emsp;即使韩国也不是铁板一块，韩国保守派一般也是亲日的，这也源于日占时期，日本对韩国精英的培育与扶持。

&emsp;&emsp;But Korea is not uniform easily. Korean conservatives are generally Pro-Japanese, and the reason for this stems from Japan's training and support of the Korean elite during the Japanese occupation.

&emsp;&emsp;所以，中共只有道义战略制高点和借尸还魂的策略还是不够的，他们会同时发挥渗透和宣传的作用，借用营销定位、占领心智模式现代营销推广与心理学的方法，进一步从预见性认知上为亚洲各国灌输日本“军国主义”的定位，抢占亚洲各国民众的心智模式，用层层递进的推广宣传方式在民众的心智模式里牢牢地确立日本“军国主义”的定位。

&emsp;&emsp;For this reason, it is not enough for the Chinese Communist Party to have only the moral strategic high ground and the strategy of resurrecting a dead soul by borrowing a corpse. They will utilize the role of infiltration and propaganda at the same time, and use the modern marketing promotion and psychology methods of marketing positioning and capturing mental models to further penetrate the positioning of Japanese "militarism" for Asian countries from the perspective of foresight and cognition, and grasp the mental models of the people in Asian countries, and firmly establish the positioning of Japanese "militarism" in the mentality models of the people by means of progressive promotion and propaganda.

&emsp;&emsp;中共国“借尸还魂”还有一个重要目的就是在亚洲国家里摸去日本二战之后成为正常国家、宪政体制，以及文化、经济上的贡献，还有为亚洲各国人民在二战中所受伤害做出的各项补偿和赔付。

&emsp;&emsp;Another significant objective of the strategy of “resurrecting a dead soul by borrowing a corpse”  is to erase Japan's role as a normal country with a well-developed constitutional system after World War II, as well as Japan's cultural and economic contributions, and to ignore the compensation and reparations made to Asian peoples for the sufferings of World War II.

&emsp;&emsp;这样中共打出的是一种叠加牌，一环套一环的，三十六计中的“连环计”。

&emsp;&emsp;In this way, the Chinese Communist Party is playing a double-insurance ploy, which is the "chain of tricks" in the 36 stratagems.

&emsp;&emsp;根据《路德社》的进一步分析和解读，中共祭出“军国主义”的这一张牌，就已经是扑克牌中的“小王”炸了，也是中共的最后一张牌了。

&emsp;&emsp;According to further analysis and interpretation by the Lude Media, the Chinese Communist Party's strategy of "Japanese militarism" is already a higher-level military strategy, and probably, is the last remaining strategy of the Chinese Communist Party.

&emsp;&emsp;在中共打出叠加牌和“小王”炸时，我们也可以同样对中共出手我们的叠加牌，还有我们的终极杀器～“大王”炸。

&emsp;&emsp;When the Chinese Communist Party proposed a double insurance strategic deployment, we also had the ultimate with a one-hit-kill response to fight back.

&emsp;&emsp;我们的叠加牌如下：

&emsp;&emsp;Our response is as follows：

1、1950年时，联合国宣布以志愿军名义参加朝鲜战争的中共国为侵略国家。

1、In 1950, the United Nations declared the Chinese communist country, which participated in the Korean War under the name of volunteer army, as an aggressor country.

2、扶持缅甸、马来西亚共产党分裂他们的国家

2、 Support the Communist Party of Burma and Malaysia in the division of their countries

3、支援北越对自由世界南越的侵略战争

3、Support North Vietnam's war against Free World South Vietnam's Invasion

4、扶持印尼共产党，制造印尼国家夺权和骚乱

4、Support the Indonesian Communist Party to generate seizure of control and disturbances within the Indonesian country.

5、一手扶助的红色高棉在柬埔寨造成200万人死亡的人间悲剧

5、Single-handedly supported The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia resulting in a human tragedy of 2 million deaths

6、中共国国内的镇压反革命、反右、文革、六四、法轮功等历次反人类罪行

6、The crackdown on Counterrevolutionary, Anti-rightist Movement, Cultural Revolution,Tiananmen massacre, persecution of Falun Gong and other crimes against humanity in the Communist Party of China

7、针对新疆、西藏和香港的罪行，新疆反人类罪、种族灭绝罪的定性

7、 Crimes against Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and the criminalization of anti-humanity and genocide in Xinjiang

8、制造病毒，对全世界人民犯下的巨大罪恶

8、Manufacturing of the virus, which is a terrible crime against people worldwide

&emsp;&emsp;其中第8点才是终极大杀器，也就是“大王”炸。这直接定性了中共是“全人类的公敌”和古今中外的“集邪恶之大成者”。

&emsp;&emsp;The eighth point is a fatal one, which directly confirms that the CCP is "the public enemy of all mankind" and "the greatest combination of evil”  in  the world ,from ancient to  modern times.

&emsp;&emsp;以上说明中共必亡，中共国的如意算盘就此落空了。

&emsp;&emsp;The above shows that the Chinese Communist Party must have been destroyed, and the Chinese Communist Party's schemes have fallen apart eventually!
