In the final years of the CCP, cities are locked down, millions of  people are in hot water, their lives are ruined. CCP cut off the living  supplies and starved its people to death. People are furious and  resentful and hereby I write:

Within the Chinese Territory, people are mostly humble, hard-working and simply wishing to make a good living. The Russian communist inspired  CCP, used deception to gain in power and deliverately made disasters to  have killed millions, created the famine of the Cultural Revolution.

The  crimes of the CCP are countless. Whereby I cited to make references for  this transcript. Since Xi came to power, he acted perversely, the  booming economy of China collapsed, and people's grievances are rife and continue to grow.

Xi is elementary school educated, solely command the power of  dictatorship in China. He is full of lies and often have  mispronunciation of words when he speaks. Citizen's livings are  disregarded under his government and Xi uses the give techniques of  people taming to slave its population, also the fights for power  struggle within the CCP have never stopped, but the people aways suffer.

Along the Belt and Road, money is thrown everywhere, the country's economy is tanked, and the state's treasury is exhausted. The people have been  taken advantage of, having their properties forcibly requisitioned and  demolished. Xi Demands loyalty without oneself and claimed himself - His Majesty.

The CCP controlled all the media, use propaganda to brainwash its people persistently. They chained and keep young girls in cages. The CCP are  the enemy of the mankind. They created the biochemical viruses spreading to the world and forcefully mandate vaccines in China, locking down  cities and isolating and leaving the people who are positive to die in  the virus concentration camps.

Xi  Used Emergency Act to have replaced the existing law and order system to have the country completely ruled by himself. Xi's gangs shut down  communities and residential quarters and pull its residents to the  isolation. The hospital refused to admit patients and patients have to  die at home.

Putin and the CCP are colluded to bring disasters to the world. The  project "Yellow Russia" will be regurgitated. Xi has an illegitimate son and he falsified the Constitution and wish to forcibly unify Taiwan to  restore his imperial system for his own generations to rule China.

The  illegal government of China, refused general election. They deprived the liberty of the people. The violent communism makes democracy sunk.  One-party dictatorship, a totalitarian regime. A Lenin's organization,  the source of evil.

Under the sun and the sky, and the human rights are constitutional. The  freedom and openness, the democratic elections, the restoration of the  Republic of China alike democratic system are our demands to overthrow  the CCP. We can wait no further.

The  provinces of China should become self-governing and the independent  referendum should be held. Through the law, each province can issue its  own declaration of independence. Establish the National Assembly, create the Constitution for China. Elect a President, and create a federation  by inviting a willing province one at a time.

The transcript is written for the annihilation of the Communist Party  and declaration of independence, endowed with human rights and defending the right of freedom. There will be segregation of powers and balancing powers by regulations and governance. With democratic constitution,  equality is for all.

Smashing down the great firewalls of the Internet and free the right of speech.  Establishing independent medias to monitor the government. Allowing  rights to own a gun and to protect private property. Defending the right to owning a gun is the guarantee for constitutions.

We are solemnly pronouncing, the independence and autonomy of all  provinces of China to break away from the CCP and cut off all  connections to the evil regime. Defend freedom, defend human rights,  make joint declarations, take the joint oath.
